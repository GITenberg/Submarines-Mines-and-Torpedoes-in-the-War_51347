  <h2 class='c014'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Warfare has become so largely a matter
of science that in order to arrive at an
intelligent understanding of the <i>naval
situation</i> or of the <i>military campaigns</i> in
the Great European War, a knowledge
of the scientific factors contributing to
victory or defeat is essential. And in
this volume it has been my aim not only
to review the actual fighting underseas,
but also to present a compendium of
information relative to the submarine
fleets and arms of the great Naval Powers
engaged; which I venture to hope will
prove of present interest on account of
the prominent part played by the under-water
fighting ships and appliances, and
of permanent historic value as being the
first work to describe the vast preparations
and curious events leading to the new
“Submarine Phase” in naval warfare.</p>

  <h2 id='intro' class='c014'>INTRODUCTION <br /> <br /> <span class='c020'>THE SUBMARINE PHASE OF THE NAVAL WAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c021'>In the mist of war which envelops over
half the entire world, no less than 264
underwater fighting ships are engaged.
They form the submarine fleets of
England, France, Russia, Japan, Germany
and Austria; and the highly-trained
crews of these modern additions to the
fighting navies comprise nearly 20,000
men. But the conduct of submarine warfare
on the grand scale requires far more
than flotillas of submergible warships
and their daring crews. This new branch
of naval science is ever widening in its
scope, its means of offence, and in its
attendant ramifications. Every important
naval base has its curious submarine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>floating docks, ready for crippled members
of its attached flotilla; every naval construction
department has its corps of
submarine experts; each of the 1,500
surface warships engaged in this titanic
struggle for the dominion of Europe and
the mastery of the seas carries the means
for delivering submarine attacks in its
torpedoes and surface and submerged discharging
tubes. The oceans in the
theatres of war have been strewn with
German and Austrian mines; then they
have been either counter-mined or swept
clear and mined again. British seaplanes,
with specially trained observers,
are continually searching from high in
the air for the <i>dark patches in the semi-transparent
sea-green</i> which denote the
presence of mines and submarines.
Within signal-range or wireless call of
the aërial scouts and their attendant ships
are destroyer flotillas to give battle to
the hostile submarines, while hundreds of
trawlers and small steamers, fitted with
special apparatus, are continually sweeping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>up the hundreds of submarine mines laid
by the enemy’s vessels which are fitted
to enable them to sow like seeds over the
pathways of the sea these deadly perils
to navigation. Submerged wire entanglements
in conjunction with boom-defences
and observation and contact submarine
mines protect the seaward approaches to
harbours in the same way as similar
appliances are used to protect the
approaches to land fortifications; and
every harbour, waterway and channel of
strategic importance is protected by
elaborate submarine mine defences. All
this is part of the new warfare underseas—that
science which is daily rendering
hazardous the life of the greatest battleship
and the smallest merchantman afloat
in the zone of war.</p>

<p class='c022'>Before placing in review order the vast
preparations made for submarine attack
and defence in the years which preceded
the outbreak of war and describing in
detail the powerful submarine fleets
engaged, it is necessary to make clear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>to the reader the wonderful change which
this new mode of attack has made in all
branches of naval warfare and its influence
on sea power. As indicative of
this change we have only to survey <i>in
their submarine aspect</i> the naval operations
in the opening phase of this, the
greatest war in history.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the domain of naval strategy we
find reflected the altered conditions caused
by these invisible arms. Every battle
on land and sea teaches its lesson of
concealment and sudden stealthy attack;
and even as the huge siege guns and
devastating artillery fire of the land
forces is causing the extension of the
battle-front and the rapid burrowing
under earth or entrenching of positions
dearly won or with difficulty retained—“approximating
to siege warfare”—so
are the powerful 12 and 13.5-inch naval
guns (weight of projectile 850 lbs. and
1,400 lbs. respectively), combined with
the rapidity and accuracy of the modern
warship’s secondary armament, necessitating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>the reduction in numbers of the
big surface ships of the opposing fleets
by frequent submarine and torpedo
attacks prior to the decisive engagements
between the battle fleets. Hence
we find, in the opening phase of the
naval war, the German and Austrian
fleets, inferior in numbers and gun
power, skulking behind fortifications and
waiting for their submarine and surface
torpedo-boats and light cruisers, in conjunction
with the hundreds of submerged
mines strewn over the North Sea, Baltic,
Adriatic and elsewhere to reduce the
number and power of the British, French,
Russian and Japanese fleets before the
decisive actions are fought; and in order
that these tactics might be frustrated, and
the big British ships, as well as those
of her allies, costing several millions
sterling each, should not be exposed
to these grave risks when no good
could result, they have been compelled
to delay initiative, and meanwhile all
their operations had to be screened by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>smaller and faster vessels of the cruiser and
destroyer types, while they waited within
call should the German Battle Fleet—in
the case of the North Sea—dare to
come out to fight. The British submarines
of the large sea-going type were
in the meantime employed in watching
the Frisian coast with the object of
attacking any of the enemy’s ships which
ventured from behind the elaborate coast
fortifications. Not content with this <i>rôle</i>,
however, several British submarines made
their way unseen through the dangerous
waters of the Heligoland Bight and
succeeded in getting within reconnoitering
distance of the German submerged
harbour defences, behind which lurk their
big ships.</p>

<p class='c022'>With what degree of success this new
opening or <i>submarine phase</i> in naval
warfare has been attended is shown by
the sinking, during the first few weeks
of the war, of the British cruiser
<i>Amphion</i>, a vessel of 3,440 tons displacement,
completed in 1912, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>carrying ten 4-inch guns, with a loss of
131 men, by contact with a German
mine; the destruction of the German
submarine U.15 by the British cruiser
<i>Birmingham</i>; the sinking of an Austrian
torpedo-boat by a mine off Pola; the
torpedoing of H.M.S. <i>Pathfinder</i>, a
fleet scout of about 3,000 tons displacement,
completed in 1905‒6, by a
German submarine; the destruction of
the Wilson liner <i>Runo</i> by a mine; the
sinking of the German cruiser <i>Hela</i>, a
vessel of 2,000 tons displacement, built
in 1896, by the British submarine E 9,
and the torpedoing of the British
armoured cruisers <i>Aboukir</i>, <i>Hogue</i> and
<i>Cressy</i>—vessels of 12,000 tons displacement,
carrying two 9.2-inch and twelve
6-inch guns besides twelve 12-pounder
quick-firing guns and two torpedo tubes—by
German submarines concealed behind
a trawler engaged in laying mines,
over which the Dutch flag had been
hoisted as a blind.</p>

<p class='c022'>This is in addition to the lamentable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>destruction of much life and property
belonging to neutral powers caused by
the laying of German floating mines on
the trade-routes.</p>

<p class='c022'>To the Allies this <i>submarine phase</i>
did not come unexpected. The British
Naval yards in conjunction with the big
shipbuilding and engineering firms, such
as Messrs. Vickers Ltd., Barrow-in-Furness;
Messrs. Armstrong, Whitworth
and Co. Ltd., Newcastle-on-Tyne; the
Whitehead Torpedo Company Ltd.,
Weymouth; Messrs. Siebe, Gorman and
Co. Ltd., London; and Messrs. Scotts’
Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. Ltd., as
well as many other firms and individual
submarine experts had been engaged for
many years in solving one after another
the problems continually arising in the
practical application of all forms of
submarine warfare. The first British
naval submarines were launched in
1901‒2 from Messrs. Vickers’ works at
Barrow, and the subsequent growth of
our submarine flotillas has been rapid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>both in number of vessels and in size
and armament. The British submarine
fleet now numbers 82 vessels. The
original boats from which the British
type has since been evolved were built
from the designs of Mr. John P. Holland,
an American inventor.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/016.jpg' alt='North Sea Coastlines' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c022'>To France belongs the honour of being
the first naval power to adopt the submarine
torpedo-boat as a vessel of war;
and the first vessel, the <i>Gymnôte</i>, was
launched in 1888, but it was not until
1893 that the Republic commenced the
construction of her now powerful submarine
flotilla, numbering 92 vessels.</p>

<p class='c022'>The first Russian submarine was
launched at Kronstadt in 1902, and
since that date the Russian flotilla has
steadily increased until it now numbers
37 vessels.</p>

<p class='c022'>Japan commenced the construction of
what is now a powerful and up-to-date
flotilla of seventeen vessels by the acquisition
of a British-Holland boat in 1904.</p>

<p class='c022'>Turning to Germany we find at first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>a great reluctance on the part of the
Ministry of Marine to provide for the
construction of submarines, but in 1905‒6
this initial hesitation was overcome and
the two vessels U.1 and U.2 were
launched. Since then the belief in a
powerful submarine flotilla steadily grew
until at the moment when war was
declared Germany possessed no less than
30 to 36 submarines of a very efficient
type. The Austro-Hungarian Navy did
not adopt submarines as units of the
Fleet until 1909, and now possess only
six small vessels.</p>

<p class='c022'>From this brief <i>resumé</i> of the growth
of the submarine fleets of the six great
naval Powers at war, it will be seen that
in point of numbers as well as in priority,
bringing with it practical experience,
Great Britain and France have a very
appreciable superiority. It must, however,
be left for succeeding chapters to
describe in detail the steady growth and
present size and capabilities of the
submarine fleets at war.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>The lessons taught by the Russo-Japanese
war were not lost on the
British Admiralty, and special methods
had been prepared to deal with submarine
attack in its various forms.
Having in mind the destruction caused
to both Russian and Japanese warships
by submarine mines—especially those
of the “offensive contact” type, which
are moored to the bottom, float just
under the surface and explode immediately
on contact; and in the Russo-Japanese
War were responsible for
the sinking of the Japanese battleships
<i>Hatsuse</i> and <i>Yashima</i> as well
as the Russian battleship <i>Petropavlovsk</i>
and the cruiser <i>Boyarin</i>—the
British Admiralty foresaw the danger to
which both warships and merchantmen
would be exposed in time of war if the
seas strewn with these mines could not
be quickly cleared, and a new type of
auxiliary came into being. This was the
mine-sweeper, and eight vessels of the old
torpedo-gunboat type were fitted out for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>the work. In addition to these, however,
the Admiralty purchased a considerable
number of steam fishing trawlers, and
fitted them with mine-sweeping appliances,
and made arrangements for a large fleet
of similar vessels to be placed at the disposal
of the navy in the event of war.
In order to man this new mine-sweeping
fleet with experienced sailors on the outbreak
of war, a new section of the Royal
Naval Reserve was created in 1911.
This is known as the “Trawler Section,”
and consists of 142 <i>skippers</i> and 1,136
men taken from the fishing fleet.</p>

<p class='c022'>Realizing the value of the submarine
mine in certain cases, the British
Admiralty went further and created a
small mine-laying fleet from seven old
second-class cruisers, which had their aft-decks
cleared and provided with rails for
a large number of mines to be run down
and slid over the stern into the water as
the vessels steamed along, thus quickly
laying a mine-field. But as the laying
of mines, speaking generally, is a defensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>mode of warfare and the policy of
the British Navy—owing to its supremacy—is
attack and not defence, the
mine-laying fleet is of second importance
to the sweeping fleet, the work of which,
although much augmented by additional
small steamers pressed into service, was,
during the first few weeks of the war,
of a nature more arduous and dangerous
than will ever be realised. Hundreds of
German mines were swept up, and
hundreds more were exploded by being
dragged into contact with each other during
the progress of sweeping operations.</p>

<p class='c022'>What the clearance of these vast fields
of floating and anchored mines in the
North Sea meant to the British Navy,
engaged in blockading the German
Fleet, and to the Mercantile Marine not
only of England, France, Russia and
Belgium, but also to that of the neutral
countries, it is perhaps a little difficult to
realize until one remembers that several
hundred British and French warships
were patrolling the North Sea and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Channel, and, at the opening of hostilities,
there were hundreds of merchantmen
homeward bound whose course lay across
this mine-infested sea. Many of these
vessels had on board not only valuable
cargoes of food, raw material for manufacture
and gold and silver bullion, but
also officers and men returning from
various parts of the world to rejoin their
regiments. Again, the Expeditionary
Force had to be transported across the
Channel to France. This could not be
attempted until a guarantee had been
given by the Navy that the seas were
clear of hostile warships, submarines and
mines. The fleet blockading the
Frisian coast had to be supplied with
coal and fresh food; and last but by no
means least it was of vital importance
to the Allied Armies in the Field that
the whole coast-line from Bordeaux to
Antwerp, forming the rear and left-flank,
should be accessible to friendly shipping.
It is not difficult to realize what would
have been the effect had thousands of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>these deadly German contact mines been
allowed to float unhindered in these
narrow seas, for, notwithstanding the
magnificent effort made by thousands of
seamen in hundreds of mine-sweepers
assisted by seaplanes, many vessels—some
belonging to neutral powers and
others to the enemy themselves—were
destroyed before the seas could be effectively
swept clear, the hostile mine-layers
destroyed or chased into port and there
blockaded with their cowardly fleet.</p>

<p class='c022'>The torpedo has long been recognised
as one of the most effective of naval
arms. It is carried by every modern
warship afloat, but it is essentially the
arm of the submarine and of the small
and fast surface vessel. For a torpedo
attack to be successful it is absolutely
necessary for the vessel carrying the
weapon to get within about 1,000 yards
of the object of attack. The difficulty
of accomplishing this manœuvre with an
enemy on the alert is easily apparent,
but if the attacking vessel can creep up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>to within torpedo range unobserved her
chances of sinking the enemy are decidedly
good, and it is the quality
possessed by the submarine of making
herself invisible by sinking beneath the
surface and approaching her enemy
“seeing but unseen” that makes this
type of vessel the ideal torpedo-boat.
But, like everything else, there are limits
to its use, for a submarine, although it can
navigate on the surface like an ordinary
torpedo-boat, cannot deliver a submerged
attack at night owing to the periscopes,
which are the “eyes” of these underwater
fighting ships, being useless in the dark.
When night covers the sea, however, the
chances of the fast grey-painted surface
torpedo-boat or destroyer being able to
approach the enemy unseen are more
than doubled, and in this way fleets
become exposed to submarine torpedo
attack by day and surface torpedo attack
by night. Further, a submarine will often
attack while a seaplane hovers over the
enemy in order to draw attention. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>is this constant exposure to sudden
and unseen submarine attack which is
primarily responsible for the terrible
nerve strain imposed on the crews of
modern surface warships in time of war.</p>

<p class='c022'>Owing to the ability of submarines to
deliver stealthy attacks by day, naval
tacticians have designated this type of
craft “Daylight torpedo-boats,” but they
are rapidly passing beyond the purely
torpedo and coastal defensive stage and
are taking on to themselves the <i>rôle</i> of
the ocean cruiser. The size of these
vessels has increased from 50 to 1,000
tons displacement in ten years. They
now carry not only a considerable
number of the largest size torpedo but
also quick-firing guns for repelling attacks
by small surface vessels, and are capable
of accompanying fleets to sea. The
Australian naval submarines A.E.1 and
A.E.2 both made the voyage from
Barrow to Sydney under their own
power and without convoy. The radius
of action of the latest vessels both of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>British and French Navies amounts to
several thousand miles. In the case of
the British “F” class the displacement
has risen to 1,500 tons, the speed to 20
knots and the armament to six torpedo
tubes and four 12-pounder quick-firing
guns, thus making them in every sense
ocean cruisers capable of keeping the
sea in almost any weather and possessing
wide range of action and considerable
offensive power. Hitherto British submarines,
like the ordinary surface
torpedo-boats, have been known by
numbers only, but the latest vessels are
to receive names which indicates the
increase in size and importance of these
craft. They may be termed the advance
guards of the submarine battleships of
the future.</p>

<p class='c022'>The torpedo, which is the principal
arm of the submarine boat, is itself a
submarine projectile. After being discharged
from the firing tube it sinks a
short distance below the surface and is
propelled by its own engines at a high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>rate of speed in a straight line towards
its object of attack. Great improvements
have been made during the past
ten years in the construction of these
delicate weapons. The extreme effective
range and speed has risen from 4,000
yards at 18 knots to 7,000 yards at 45
knots or 11,000 yards at 30 knots. The
“war-head” or front section of the
torpedo contains a charge of about 200
pounds of damp gun-cotton which is
fired by a detonator on the torpedo
striking an object. This very powerful
explosive charge is capable of tearing
open an enormous hole in the unprotected
under-water skin of the surface
warship. The type of weapon used in
the British, French, Russian and
Japanese Navies is the <i>Whitehead</i>
torpedo (18-inch and 21-inch). The
German Navy uses the <i>Schwartzkopf</i>
torpedo (18-inch and 21-inch), which is
very similar to the Whitehead and is a
very powerful weapon.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the first phase of the naval war no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>less than eight warships have been sunk
by submarine torpedoes.</p>

<p class='c022'>The activity of the British submarines
<i>in the theatre of war</i>, from the beginning
of hostilities, is admirably set forth in
the following dispatch from Commodore
Roger B. Keyes, C.B., which is the
first dispatch in the history of naval
warfare to describe in detail submarine
attack and reconnaissance:—</p>

<div class='c023'>H.M.S. <i>Maidstone</i>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class='c023'><i>17th October, 1914</i>.</div>

<p class='c024'>“Sir,—In compliance with Their Lordships’
directions, I have the honour to
report as follows upon the services performed
by the Submarines since the
commencement of hostilities:—</p>

<p class='c024'>“Three hours after the outbreak of war,
Submarines E.6 (Lieutenant-Commander
Cecil P. Talbot), and E.8 (Lieutenant-Commander
Francis H. H. Goodhart),
proceeded unaccompanied to carry out a
reconnaissance in the Heligoland Bight.
These two vessels returned with useful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>information, and had the privilege of
being the pioneers on a service which is
attended by some risk.</p>

<p class='c024'>“During the transportation of the Expeditionary
Force the <i>Lurcher</i> and <i>Firedrake</i>
and all the Submarines of the
Eighth Submarine Flotilla occupied
positions from which they could have
attacked the High Sea Fleet, had it
emerged to dispute the passage of our
transports. This patrol was maintained
day and night without relief, until the
<i>personnel</i> of our Army had been transported
and all chance of effective
interference had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c024'>“These Submarines have since been
incessantly employed on the Enemy’s
Coast in the Heligoland Bight and
elsewhere, and have obtained much
valuable information regarding the composition
and movement of his patrols.
They have occupied his waters and
reconnoitred his anchorages, and, while
so engaged, have been subjected to
skilful and well executed anti-submarine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>tactics; hunted for hours at a time by
Torpedo Craft and attacked by <a id='tn031'></a>gun-fire
and torpedoes.</p>

<p class='c024'>“At midnight on August 26th, I
embarked in the <i>Lurcher</i>, and, in company
with <i>Firedrake</i> and Submarines
D.2, D.8, E.4, E.5, E.6, E.7, E.8, and
E.9 of the Eighth Submarine Flotilla,
proceeded to take part in the operations
in the Heligoland Bight arranged for
August 28th. The Destroyers scouted
for the Submarines until nightfall on
the 27th, when the latter proceeded independently
to take up various positions from
which they could co-operate with the Destroyer
Flotillas on the following morning.</p>

<p class='c024'>“At daylight on August 28th the
<i>Lurcher</i> and <i>Firedrake</i> searched the
area, through which the Battle Cruisers
were to advance, for hostile Submarines,
and then proceeded towards Heligoland
in the wake of Submarines E.6, E.7,
and E.8, which were exposing themselves
with the object of inducing the
enemy to chase them to the westward.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“On approaching Heligoland, the
visibility, which had been very good
to seaward, reduced to 5,000 to 6,000
yards, and this added considerably to
the anxieties and responsibilities of the
Commanding Officers of Submarines,
who handled their vessels with coolness
and judgment in an area which was
necessarily occupied by friends as well as
foes.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Low visibility and calm sea are the
most unfavourable conditions under which
Submarines can operate, and no opportunity
occurred of closing with the
Enemy’s Cruisers to within torpedo
range.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Lieutenant-Commander Ernest W.
Leir, Commanding Submarine E.4, witnessed
the sinking of the German
Torpedo-Boat Destroyer V.187 through
his periscope, and, observing a Cruiser
of the <i>Stettin</i> class close, and open fire
on the British Destroyers which had
lowered their boats to pick up the survivors,
he proceeded to attack the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Cruiser, but she altered course before
he could get within range. After
covering the retirement of our Destroyers,
which had had to abandon their
boats, he returned to the latter, and
embarked a Lieutenant and nine men
of <i>Defender</i>, who had been left behind.
The boats also contained two Officers
and eight men of V.187, who were
unwounded, and eighteen men who were
badly wounded. As he could not embark
the latter, Lieutenant-Commander Leir
left one of the Officers and six unwounded
men to navigate the British
boats to Heligoland. Before leaving he
saw that they were provided with water,
biscuit, and a compass. One German
Officer and two men were made prisoners
of war.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Lieutenant-Commander Leir’s action
in remaining on the surface in the
vicinity of the enemy and in a visibility
which would have placed his vessel within
easy gun range of an enemy appearing
out of the mist, was altogether admirable.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“This enterprising and gallant Officer
took part in the reconnaissance which
supplied the information on which these
operations were based, and I beg to
submit his name, and that of Lieutenant-Commander
Talbot, the Commanding
Officer of E.6, who exercised patience,
judgment, and skill in a dangerous
position, for the favourable consideration
of Their Lordships.</p>

<p class='c024'>“On September 13th, E.9 (Lieutenant-Commander
Max K. Horton) torpedoed
and sank the German Light
Cruiser <i>Hela</i> six miles South of Heligoland.</p>

<p class='c024'>“A number of Destroyers were evidently
called to the scene after E.9 had
delivered her attack, and these hunted
her for several hours.</p>

<p class='c024'>“On September 14th, in accordance
with his orders, Lieutenant-Commander
Horton examined the outer anchorage
of Heligoland, a service attended by
considerable risk.</p>

<p class='c024'>“On September 25th, Submarine E.6
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>(Lieutenant-Commander C. P. Talbot),
while diving, fouled the moorings of a
mine laid by the enemy. On rising to
the surface she weighed the mine and
sinker; the former was securely fixed
between the hydroplane and its guard;
fortunately, however, the horns of the
mine were pointed outboard. The weight
of the sinker made it a difficult and
dangerous matter to lift the mine clear
without exploding it. After half an
hour’s patient work this was effected by
Lieutenant Frederick A. P. Williams-Freeman
and Able Seaman Ernest
Randall Cremer, Official Number 214235,
and the released mine descended to its
original depths.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>In conclusion, it must therefore be set
on record that the opening phase in the
greatest naval war in history has been
one of submarine attack and counter-attack,
mine-laying and destroying, warships
and merchantmen sunk in a few
minutes by submarine torpedoes and
mines, with sharp engagements between
the cruisers and destroyers acting in
conjunction with the under-water craft.
The much-vaunted German Fleet, like
that of its ally Austria-Hungary, has
not dared to show itself from behind
the forts and carefully-screened anchorages
of the naval bases, suffering rather
the everlasting disgrace of having stood
in cowardly idleness while the 5,000
merchant ships it was built to protect
hauled down the flag of the “Fatherland”
and German maritime commerce
was swept from the seas while the Allied
fleets hold undisputed command of every
ocean.</p>

<p class='c022'>The First Lord of the British
Admiralty has said that if the German
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Fleet will not come out to fight it must
be “dug out like rats in a hole.” This,
then, may be the second phase in the
naval war, and out in the grey mist of
the North Sea, ready and eager for
the work, lies the great battle fleets of
England.</p>

  <h2 id='ch1' class='c014'>CHAPTER I <br /> <br /> <span class='c020'>THE MODERN SUBMARINE TORPEDO-BOAT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The submarine torpedo-boat is to most
people a complete mystery, and before
describing the composition and strength
of the submarine fleets at war it may
therefore be of interest to say something
of the principal features common to all
types of submarine craft.</p>

<h3 class='c026'><i>Method of Submergence</i></h3>

<p class='c027'>It may sound ridiculous, in face of the
many accidents which have occurred, to
say that one of the greatest difficulties
is to make a submarine sink sufficiently
quickly, and one of the easiest of
operations to make her rise, and yet
such is undeniably the case.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c028'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>It will be readily understood that
any delay in disappearing beneath the
surface when attacking would be a
great danger to a submarine in action.
For example, a number of hostile torpedo-boat
destroyers are scouring the
sea in advance of a fleet, and are discovered
at daybreak by the submarines,
which are waiting to attack the fleet behind,
approaching at a speed of 30 knots
an hour. A hurried dive beneath the
surface is necessary if the waiting submarines
would avoid detection, which
would, in all probability, mean destruction
by the quick-firing guns of the destroyers.</p>

<p class='c022'>When a submarine is travelling on the
surface she is in what is technically called
the <i>light condition</i>, that is to say, with her
water ballast tanks empty, but when it is
required to sink her so that only the tiny
platform, or deck, and conning-tower are
above the surface, water is let into these
ballast tanks, and the additional weight
causes her to sink into the sea until her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span><i>back</i> is almost flush with the surface—this
is known as the <i>awash condition</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>It is not difficult to perceive that when
travelling awash, a wave might at any
moment roll along the tiny unprotected
deck of the submarine, break over the
mouth of the conning-tower, and descend
like a waterspout into the interior. Were
this to happen a terrible disaster might
result, for it must be remembered that
when travelling awash, a very little
additional weight would cause the submarine
to plunge beneath the surface.
In order to obviate this risk it has
become a rule that when proceeding
with this small margin of buoyancy,
the hatch covering the mouth of the
conning-tower should be screwed down
and the submarine hermetically closed,
ready to sink.</p>

<p class='c022'>To many it may appear strange that
total submergence is not accomplished
by letting still more water into the
ballast tanks, but entirely with the aid
of the propellers and rudders. A submarine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>has two, and sometimes three,
pairs of rudders; one pair of ordinary
vertical ones to guide her to port or
starboard, and a horizontal pair to cause
her to dive and rise. Two additional
<i>fins</i> are frequently placed on each side of
the forepart of the vessel to assist the
diving and rising.</p>

<p class='c022'>In order to make the submarine dive
beneath the surface, the horizontal
rudders are deflected when the boat is
proceeding at full speed. The action of
the water against the rudders is such
that the bows are forced down and the
whole vessel slides under the surface.
The principle is much the same as that
of steering an ordinary surface vessel,
where the force of the water against the
rudder causes the vessel to swing to
right or left.</p>

<p class='c022'>From this it will be seen that a submarine
is only held below the surface
by the action of her rudders on the
passing water; should the propellers
driving her along cease to revolve and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the vessel slow down, she automatically
rises to the surface because the rudders
have no longer any effect.</p>

<p class='c022'>Although the steering both on the
vertical and horizontal plane is controlled
by hand, it would be quite beyond the
strength of a man to move the various
rudders as required, so electric motors
are installed to perform the actual work.
In fact, almost everything in a submarine
is operated by electricity.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the earlier types of submarine
boats, a considerable time was required
to open the valves and allow sufficient
water to enter the ballast tanks to make
them sink to the awash condition. Some
of the now obsolete French naval boats
took as long as fifteen to twenty minutes
to carry out this simple operation. The
main reason for this was, that they
were designed with too much surface
buoyancy, that is to say, they rode too
high in the water when floating in the
light condition compared with the inadequate
means then employed for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>inlet of water into the ballast tanks, and
were thus forced to let in an enormous
quantity of water at a very slow rate
before they settled down sufficiently to
enable total submergence to be accomplished
by the use of the horizontal fins
and rudders. This great drawback has
now been completely overcome, and the
modern submarine can sink below the
surface in about three minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'>When water is pumped into the ballast
tanks in order to make the submarine
settle down, the air which normally fills
these tanks is compressed into a fraction
of its proper space, and is therefore
always exerting a downward pressure
which increases as more water is pumped
in. Therefore, when it is desired to
bring the submarine to the surface again,
all that is necessary is to open the
valves and allow the compressed air to
force the water out. It should, however,
be remembered that there is really no
need to “blow out” the ballast tanks
in order to bring the submarine to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>surface, for this can be much quicker
accomplished by simply elevating the
horizontal rudders; but in this case the
submarine only rises just above the
surface—to the awash condition—whereas
if the tanks are emptied of water she
rises to the light or cruising condition.
This substantiates the assertion made
at the beginning of this chapter—that it
is far more difficult to make a submarine
sink than it is to make her rise.</p>

<p class='c022'>It has been said that a man walking
from one end of a submarine to the other
would, in all probability, cause her to
plunge dangerously, so delicate is the
state of equipoise when totally submerged.
Whatever may have been the case in
the early types it is certainly not so now.
So steady are modern submarines when
running below the surface, especially
those of the British, Russian, French,
and Japanese and German Navies, that
the long up and down hill glides, which,
with some boats, used to amount to
yaws of from 20 to 30 feet, have now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>been reduced to a few feet in so many
hundreds of yards. In fact, this switch-back
motion is almost unnoticeable
except when the submarine is being
swung round at a sharp angle. In no
case, however, is it sufficient materially
to affect the firing of the torpedoes.</p>

<p class='c022'>The reserve buoyancy of a submarine in
the awash condition—or <i>diving-trim</i>, as it
is called in the British flotillas—is necessarily
very small, amounting to little
more than two or three pounds in a
thousand, which in a 300-ton vessel means
a difference of only about 100 gallons of
sea-water between the ability to float
and the inevitability of sinking. Any
material increase in the small margin of
what is known as <i>positive-buoyancy</i> must
be accompanied by a corresponding
increase in the power of propulsion,
otherwise it would be quite impossible to
drive her under, or, in other words, to
overcome the vessel’s natural tendency
to float on the surface.</p>

<p class='c022'>For these and other reasons, a submarine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>when running submerged is in
such a delicate state of equipoise that
any sudden increase or loss of weight
would upset the balance and so cause
the vessel to either dive or rise with
dangerous rapidity.</p>

<p class='c022'>This would be the effect produced
when a torpedo was discharged were
provision not made to counter-balance
this sudden loss of weight by means of
<i>compensating-tanks</i>, into which sufficient
water is pumped to compensate for the
loss of weight incurred by the discharge
of <i>each</i> torpedo.</p>

<p class='c022'>Many submarines are also fitted with
bow and stern <i>trimming-tanks</i>, into which
water can be pumped in such a manner
as to correct any tendency of the vessel
to float too high or low at either
extremity.</p>

<h3 class='c026'><i>Propulsion.</i></h3>

<p class='c027'>Of the many complicated problems
surrounding submarine boat construction
the motive power and propelling engines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>have been in the past, and are still, the
most profound puzzles. Steam, compressed
air, electricity, petrol, and heavy
oil have all been used with varying
results since first this type of vessel
came into being; and many curious
engines for using these <i>prime movers</i> in
conjunction with each other and with
chemical compounds have been evolved
by ingenious inventors.</p>

<p class='c022'>About steam and compressed air little
need be said, for although given a good
trial, especially by the French naval
authorities, they were abandoned some
years ago in favour of a combination of
petrol and electric engines, which in turn
have given place to more powerful
machines using heavy oil and electricity.
Steam is, however, again being
used in conjunction with turbine engines
for surface propulsion.</p>

<p class='c022'>The carrying of large quantities of
petrol, or heavy oil, is under all circumstances
attended with a certain
amount of risk, and when many tons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>have to be carried in a confined
space, as in a submarine, this risk is
more than doubled, as the slightest
leakage when the vessel is submerged
would mean that a powerful explosive
mixture of petrol and air would be made.</p>

 </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>It being also quite impossible, for
obvious reasons, to use a petrol engine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>when running submerged, a second
motive power, an engine, with its additional
space and weight, has to be
carried to drive the submarine when
under water. For this purpose electricity
is used in almost all types. But
electricity, again, has many drawbacks.
It costs in weight nearly thirty times
more than other motive powers, and is
extremely dangerous, for should salt
water in any way gain access to the
storage batteries, chlorine gas would be
given off in large quantities, although in
the more recent vessels of the British,
American, and French Navies this danger
has been minimised by enclosing the
batteries in air-tight cases. On account
of the weight and the space required,
it is impossible to install a very powerful
electric engine in a submarine
(compared with the size of the boat),
and thus both the speed and radius of
action are curtailed.</p>

<p class='c022'>If this division of power between the
surface and submerged engines could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>be overcome, and the whole space made
available for one powerful set of engines
suitable for driving the vessel both on
the surface and when submerged, not
only would the mechanism of submarines
be simplified, but a very considerable
increase in both speed and range of
action would naturally result.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the “D,” “E” and “F” classes
of British submarines, and in the more
modern vessels of the French, Russian
and German Navies, heavy oil is being
used in place of petrol on account of the
increase in power obtained with greater
safety.</p>

<p class='c022'>Arrangements are made in almost all
modern submarines so that when the
vessel is using the oil engines for running
on the surface the electricity for use
when submerged is being made by a
dynamo and stored in batteries. From
this it will be seen that there are really
three separate engines in a submarine:—(1)
the oil or petrol motor, which drives
the vessel when on the surface, and, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the same time, by a suitable arrangement
of gearing, operates a dynamo, (2)
which makes the electric current for
storage, and (3) an electric engine which
drives the vessel when submerged,
obtaining the necessary power from the
batteries.</p>

<p class='c022'>It is, however, technically incorrect
to say that there are two sources of
power in a submarine, for electricity is
not, in itself, a source of power, but
merely a handy method of storing and
transmitting it. The only actual source
being the oil or petrol.</p>

<p class='c022'>There are also numerous small engines
to add to the complexity of machinery
in a submarine, such as the air compressors
used for charging the torpedo
tubes with compressed air for expelling
the torpedoes and for other purposes,
and electric motors for operating the
pumps, steering mechanism, and periscopes.
In addition to all this, hand-mechanism
is provided for use in case
of a breakdown to operate most of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>important appliances. Then again there
is, of course, the armament mechanism
for working the torpedo tubes and semi-automatic
quick-firing guns.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the foregoing it may appear that
the interior of a submarine presents a
picture of mechanical complexity utterly
incomprehensible. Yet such is not the
case. The fanciful belief that the crew
stand, boxed up in these vessels, sweating
with the heat, struggling for breath,
and with crank-shafts whirling uncomfortably
close to the small of their backs,
electric motors buzzing within a few
inches of their ears, and nervous hands
grasping one or other of the levers
ranged in rows in front of them, is,
doubtless, most romantic, but quite
unreal. Much of the undoubtedly complicated
machinery in a submarine is
tucked away in the conical extremities,
under the interior decking, and fixed
to the arched steel sides. The centre
is left almost entirely clear, so that
trestle-tables may be erected for meals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>hammocks swung for sleeping, and
sufficient space allowed to make these
small vessels as habitable as possible.
Not the least difficulty of the submarine
designer is to create order and leave
space among the chaos of machinery
which has to be installed in these peculiar
and deadly little torpedo craft.</p>

<h3 class='c026'><i>Vision When Submerged.</i></h3>

<p class='c027'>Perhaps the greatest difficulty which
has beset both submarine construction and
navigation is the puzzle how to see when
submerged. This is now accomplished
by means of periscopes, or tubes extending
up from the roof of the submarine
to a height of several feet above the
surface—not unlike hollow masts. By a
series of lenses and reflectors a picture of
the surface is thrown down these tubes
on to reflectors inside the submarine. A
man with his eyes at the bottom of a
periscope can see the surface clearly.
Although it projects above the surface
when the whole submarine is submerged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>it is far too small an object to be easily
seen moving through the water, and
extremely difficult to hit by gun-fire.</p>

<p class='c022'>The latest panoramic periscope—two of
which are fitted in modern submarines—has
a field of vision of about 60
degrees. The range of vision is, however,
very short, owing to the periscopic
tube projecting only a few feet above the
surface. On a moderately smooth and
fairly clear day steering by periscope is
not altogether difficult, but at night or
in fog this instrument is useless, and for
this reason it would be almost impossible
for a submarine to effect a submerged
attack on an enemy at night. Hence
the name given to this type of craft—daylight
torpedo-boats—for in the brilliant
light of day, when any attempt by
ordinary torpedo craft to get sufficiently
close to hostile warships to discharge a
torpedo with reasonable hope of success
would be foredoomed to failure, there is
every possibility that submarines would
effect a surprise attack.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>
<h3 class='c026'><i>Armament.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c027'>The chief armament of all naval submarines
is the torpedo, which is expelled
by a blast of compressed air from one of
the tubes fitted in the bow and stern.
Several torpedoes are usually carried by
each boat, so that if one failed to strike
the object of attack further attempts can
be made.</p>

<p class='c022'>About the efficiency of torpedoes
nothing need be said here, for they now
form an important weapon in every navy,
and to this subject a future chapter is
devoted.</p>

<p class='c022'>The latest submarines built are also
fitted with quick-firing guns for use when
these vessels are cruising on the surface.
The guns are arranged so that when it is
desired to sink they can be made to
disappear beneath the narrow deck of the
submarine. The provision of guns has
been made with the object of giving
these vessels a means of defence should
they be discovered by prowling hostile
torpedo-boat destroyers, or by air-craft.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>
<h3 class='c026'><i>Habitability.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Many people imagine the interior of a
submarine to resemble a stokehold, hot,
stifling, and semi-dark, whereas the exact
contrary is the truth. The temperature
is but little above the normal for a ship’s
engine-room, the air-supply is amply
sufficient, and the whole interior is well
illuminated by electric lamps.</p>

<p class='c022'>The necessary supply of pure air is
derived either from large steel cylinders
containing the air in a highly compressed
state or from flasks of oxylithe. The
carbonic acid gas of the respired air
being at the same time chemically
absorbed.</p>

<p class='c022'>Food is cooked for the crew by
electricity, and drinking water obtained
from special tanks. Notwithstanding
these arrangements, however, it is almost
impossible for the crew to live on board
for many weeks at a time, owing to the
small free space in the interior and to the
cramped deck; but as the size and radius
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>of action of these boats increase, so also
does the space available for exercise, and
thus the habitability.</p>

<p class='c022'>The statement that the headquarters
of the various submarine flotillas in home
waters are at Chatham, Portsmouth, and
Devonport, must not be taken as indicating
that these are the only points
along the coast protected by submarines.
These places are merely the chief bases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>of the <i>Patrol Flotillas</i>. The wide range
of action of modern submarines enables
them to operate several hundred miles
from any base or depôt, and consequently
Chatham becomes merely the
<i>general store</i>, or head-depôt, of what
should be termed the North Sea Flotillas,
which not only patrol the whole East,
North-East and South-East Coasts of
England and Scotland, but also have
their floating secondary bases in the
form of <i>Depôt Ships</i>, which, with their
attached submarines, are often at
Harwich, Newcastle, Rosyth, etc. In
the same way Portsmouth is merely the
headquarters of the submarines patrolling
the Channel; and Dover, Portland, etc.,
are seldom without strong flotillas of submarines
with their Depôt ships. The
Devonport Flotillas have the longest
coast-line to patrol, for their area covers
not only the West Coast of England,
Wales and Scotland, but also the Irish
Coast. They are, however, furthest
removed from the zone of war.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Considerable alterations have taken
place in the composition and distribution
of the British submarine flotillas since
the outbreak of war, with the object of
materially strengthening the Fleet in
the main theatre of operations, but the
addition to the flotillas of new vessels of
the latest “E” type—nearly completed
when war broke out—has made this
rearrangement possible without materially
weakening the flotillas guarding the more
distant coasts of Great Britain or recalling
vessels from overseas.</p>

    <div>THE BRITISH SUBMARINE “D.7.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Displacement, 620 tons; Speed, 16·10 knots; Armament, 2 bow and 1 stern torpedo tube.</div>
    <div class='c001'>There are 8 vessels of this class, completed between 1908‒12.</div>
  </div>
</div>

 </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>The first submarine torpedo-boat built
for the British Navy was launched from
the yard of Messrs. Vickers Ltd., Barrow-in-Furness
in 1901, and was designated
the No. 1. It was constructed from the
designs of the famous American inventor,
Mr. John P. Holland, and was one of the
most successful boats afloat at that time.
A series of exhaustive trials with this
and the succeeding five vessels, all of the
same type and launched during 1901‒2,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>proved conclusively the fighting value of
this type of craft, and a further order was
given by the British Admiralty for four
new vessels embodying the improvements
suggested by the trials of the
first five. These vessels were the first
of the “A” class, and were designated
the “A’s 1, 2, 3, and 4.” They had a
submerged displacement of 180 tons, a
length of 100 feet and a beam of 10 feet.
They were propelled by petrol motors
of 190 <span class='fss'>H.-P.</span> on the surface and by
electric motors of about 80 <span class='fss'>H.-P.</span> when
submerged. Their speed ranged from 8
knots an hour on the surface to 5 knots
when travelling submerged, and their
maximum surface endurance (or fuel
capacity) was only 400 knots at 8 knots.
Their armament consisted of three 18-inch
Whitehead torpedoes and one bow tube.</p>

<p class='c022'>All these vessels were, however,
obsolete and therefore scrapped before
the opening of hostilities, hence information
concerning them is only of
interest as showing the rapid growth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>in size, power and armament of British
submarines. The next batch of vessels
were the A’s 5 to 13, launched at
Barrow in 1904, but these, as will have
been seen from the table showing the
composition and distribution of the submarine
flotillas at the outbreak of war,
are still on the effective list. All the
following British submarines are now in
the fighting line.</p>

<h4 class='c030'><span class='sc'>“A” Class.</span></h4>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c031'>
    <div>(Completed 1904.)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c032'>
    <div>A’s 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>These vessels are the oldest British
submarines in commission. They were
built at Messrs. Vickers’ works at
Barrow, and have a submerged displacement
of 204 tons. Their length is
150 feet. They are propelled on the
surface by petrol motors of 600 <span class='fss'>H.-P.</span>
and by electric engines of 100 <span class='fss'>H.-P.</span>
when submerged. Their surface and
submerged speed is 11 knots and
7 knots respectively. The cruising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>range, or maximum surface endurance
on the fuel carried, is 400 knots at 10
knots an hour, and the endurance submerged
three hours at full speed. Their
armament consists of two bow tubes with
four 18-inch Whitehead torpedoes. Complement:
Eleven officers and men.</p>

<p class='c022'>These vessels, which are now used
almost entirely for harbour defence, can
be distinguished from later types by
their high conning-towers and single
short periscopes. The A.7 was lost off
Plymouth early in 1914, and was never
raised.</p>

<h4 class='c030'><span class='sc'>“B” Class.</span></h4>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c031'>
    <div>(Completed 1904‒6.)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c032'>
    <div>B’s 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>These are submarines of the improved
Holland type, and are in every way
superior to their predecessors. They
may be considered the first of the sea-going
type. Their submerged displacement
is 316 tons; length 135 feet, and
beam 13 ½ feet. The motive power is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>same as in the “A’s”—petrol for surface
propulsion and electricity for use when
submerged. The horse-power of the
petrol engines is 600, and that of the
electric engines 189. As in most submarines
the supply of current for driving
the electric engines is derived from storage
batteries charged by dynamos driven from
the petrol engines while the vessels are
running on the surface. In the “B”
class a special system of encasing these
storage batteries was introduced. Their
speed averages 12 knots on the surface
and 8 knots when submerged. The surface
cruising range is 1,300 knots at 10
knots per hour, and the maximum submerged
endurance 80‒100 knots at 5
knots per hour. Their armament consists
of two bow tubes with 4‒6 18-inch
Whitehead torpedoes. Complement: Sixteen
officers and men.</p>

<p class='c022'>The “B” type are vessels about 50
per cent. larger than the “A” type which
preceded them. The “B’s” have superstructures
extending from the bow to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>conning-tower, forming a narrow deck
which tends to disperse the wave which
heaped around the blunt noses of the
“A’s” and original Hollands. Vision
when submerged is obtained by two
panoramic periscopes, each having an arc
of vision of 60 degrees. In the more
modern vessels three periscopes are fitted.
The twin screws of the “B’s” are placed
below the centre line of the vessel and
consequently operate in deeper water
when the vessels are cruising on the
surface. This gives them better surface
cruising qualities, as in a sea-way the
propellers are liable to race if worked
too near the surface. The increase in
the speed of these vessels over that of the
“A’s” was of great importance, as in
this respect lies the weakness of the submarine.
The tactical advantages derived
from high speed in actual warfare cannot
be over-estimated. The speed of a fleet
is governed by that of its slowest unit.</p>

<p class='c022'>The distinguishing feature of the “B”
type is the straight bow, the forward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>superstructure, and the <i>two</i> periscopes.
The B.2 was run down by the liner
<i>Amerika</i> in the Straits of Dover in
October, 1912, and was never recovered.</p>

    <div>C’s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>This class of submarines is composed
of vessels of the improved “B” type.
They have a submerged displacement
of 320 tons and are 135 feet long and
13 ½ feet broad. The petrol motors develop
600 <span class='fss'>H.-P.</span> and give to these vessels a
speed of 14 knots an hour on the surface.
The power of the electric engines was
increased to 300 <span class='fss'>H.-P.</span>, giving a submerged
speed of just over 9 knots an
hour. The surface cruising range is
2,000 knots at the most economical speed,
and the submerged endurance 100 knots
at 5 knots an hour. Their armament
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>consists of two bow tubes with six
18-inch Whitehead torpedoes; and their
complement sixteen officers and men.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the later vessels of the “C” class
heavy oil is used instead of petrol, giving
a great increase in power without the
comparative additional weight; enabling
a wider radius of action. The vessels
of both the “B” and “C” classes are
fitted with air-traps and safety-helmets,
giving the crew a possible means of
escape in the event of disaster while
submerged.</p>

<p class='c022'>The distinguishing feature of the “C”
class is the sloping bow. The C.11
collided with the steamer <i>Eddystone</i>
in the North Sea in 1909 and was
irretrievably lost.</p>

    <div>D’s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>These are all modern vessels of the
sea-going type, and are of considerable
fighting value. They, however, differ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>slightly from each other: D.1 has a
submerged displacement of 595 tons;
D.2 of 600 tons; and the remaining
vessels of this class of 620 tons. They
have an approximate length of 150 feet
and a beam of 15 feet. Heavy-oil
engines of 1,200 <span class='fss'>H.-P.</span> drive them at a
maximum speed of 16 knots an hour on
the surface, and electric motors of 550
<span class='fss'>H.-P.</span> give them a submerged speed of
just over 10 knots an hour. All these
vessels have twin-screws situated below
the centre line. Their cruising range on
the surface is 4,000 miles, and when
submerged 120 knots at 7 knots an
hour. These vessels were the first to
be fitted with a special and more efficient
pattern of electric storage battery and a
safer type of electric motor. The armament
of the “D’s” consists of two bow
and one stern tube with six 18-inch Whitehead
torpedoes. D’s 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8
are also fitted with a small quick-firing,
high-angle gun for defence against air-craft.
This gun is fixed on a disappearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>mounting, enabling it to be quickly and
almost automatically lowered into a watertight
cavity in the superstructure before
the submarine dives below the surface.
The complement of these vessels is
twenty-one officers and men.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>These fine ocean-going submarines are
the latest additions to the British Flotillas.
They have a submerged displacement of
800 tons, are 176 feet long and 22 ½ feet
in beam. The heavy-oil engines of
nearly 2,000 <span class='fss'>H.-P.</span> give them a surface
speed of over 16 knots, while the
electric engines of 800 <span class='fss'>H.-P.</span> drive them
at a maximum speed of 10 knots an
hour when submerged. Their surface
cruising range is 5,000 miles at
economical speed, and the submerged
endurance 140 knots at 8 knots an hour.
In point of armament the “E’s” are far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>more powerful than their predecessors,
being fitted with four tubes and carrying
six of the largest and most powerful
Whitehead torpedoes. They are also
equipped with two 3-inch quick-firing
guns on high-angle disappearing mountings
for defence against air-craft and
hostile torpedo-boats and destroyers<a id='tn079'></a>.
They have wireless telegraphic apparatus;
and, like the vessels of the “B,” “C”
and “D” classes, have armoured conning
towers and decks. Three tall panoramic
periscopes are fitted, and their high
superstructures and increased buoyancy
when travelling on the surface enable
them to keep the sea in almost any
weather.</p>

<p class='c022'>These vessels are exactly the same
as the “E” class. The fact that they
both accomplished the 13,000-mile voyage
from Barrow to Sydney under their
own power and without convoy is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>practical proof of the wide range, seaworthiness
and general efficiency of the
latest British Naval Submarines. The
A.E.1 mysteriously disappeared in
Australian waters in October, 1914, and
has not been recovered.</p>

<h3 class='c026'><span class='sc'>British Submarines Building<a id='tn080'></a>.</span></h3>

<p class='c027'>At the commencement of the great
war there were 22 British submarines in
course of construction at the various
shipbuilding works and naval dockyards.
Up to 1909 Messrs. Vickers Ltd., had
constructed all the British submarines,
but in that year the vessels C.17 and
C.18 were laid down at Chatham Dockyard.
Since then several other boats
have been constructed there, and of
those now in hand some are being built
by Messrs. Vickers Ltd. at Barrow,
others at Messrs. Scott’s shipbuilding
yards at Greenock, and a few by Messrs.
Armstrong, Whitworth and Co. Ltd.
at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and at H.M.
Dockyard at Chatham.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Hitherto, British submarines, although
divided into classes—each of which has
shown a marked improvement on the
preceding class—have been all of one
type—the “Improved Holland.” Among
the vessels being constructed at the
opening of hostilities they were, however,
no less than three different types.
Those being built at Barrow and
Chatham were of the original design
with modern improvements, but the submarines
under construction at Greenock
were of the <i>Laurenti</i>, or Italian type,
and those at Newcastle-on-Tyne of the
<i>Laubeuf</i>, or French type. In addition
to this wise departure from previous
practice, two of the new vessels have
been given the names of <i>Nautilus</i> and
<i>Swordfish</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>The haze of war has obscured these
vessels, and it is impossible to say definitely
which of them have taken their
place in the active flotillas, and further
the necessity for observing the very
strictest secrecy regarding new types of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>warships at a time like the present
makes it advisable to give here only
the briefest particulars and not to discuss
too freely the peculiarities of their design
or their probable capabilities.</p>

<h4 class='c030'><span class='sc'>“F” Class.</span></h4>

<p class='c027'>There are several vessels of this class
now being constructed. They are the
latest improvement of the original Holland
design and are sea-going submarines
of wide range, high speed and great
fighting power. The F.1, which was
built at Chatham Dockyard, has a submerged
displacement of 1,500 tons.
Heavy-oil engines of about 5,000 <span class='fss'>H.-P.</span>
give her a maximum speed of 20 knots
an hour on the surface, and electric
motors of 2,000 <span class='fss'>H.-P.</span> drive her at 12 knots
when submerged. The armament consists
of six torpedo tubes, ten torpedoes, and
two quick-firing, high-angle guns.</p>

<h4 class='c030'><span class='sc'>“V” Class. &nbsp;“W” Class. &nbsp;“S” Class.</span></h4>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c031'>
    <div><i>Nautilus</i> and <i>Swordfish</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>These three classes include the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>vessels of entirely different design to
those now forming the British flotillas.
The “V,” or Vickers’ type, of which
four were under construction at the
beginning of the war, are large sea-going
submarines with a submerged
displacement of over 1,000 tons, and a
probable surface speed of 20 knots.
The “W” Class, of which four are
being built at Elswick, comprise vessels
of the French <i>Laubeuf</i> type. The “S”
Class, building at Greenock, and four
in number, are of the Italian, or F.I.A.T.—<i>Laurenti</i>
type. The two named
vessels—<i>Nautilus</i> and <i>Swordfish</i>—are
large sea-going submarines of wide
range and high speed. Their submerged
displacement is about 1,000
tons, and their speed 20 knots on the
surface and 12 knots when submerged.
The armament is six tubes, with eight
torpedoes, and two quick-firing guns.

</div>

<p class='c021'>France possessed 92 submarines in
active service when war was declared.
In addition to these, nine large and
powerful vessels were in various stages
of construction. The flotillas of the
French Navy are composed of two
different types of vessels: <i>Submarines
Defensive</i> and <i>Submersibles</i>. The former
are intended, as their name implies,
solely for coast and harbour defence;
their radii of action is very small, and
they are incapable of action independent
of a naval base. The submersibles are
like the large sea-going submarines of
England and Germany, and have a
wide radius of action, high speed, and
great offensive power.</p>

<p class='c022'>The first naval submarine (<i>Gymnôte</i>)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>was launched in 1888, giving to France
the honour of being the first Naval
Power to adopt the submarine torpedo-boat
as a vessel of war. The pioneers
of submarine construction in France
were Captain Burgeoise, Engineer Brun,
M. Dupuy de Lome, M. Gustave Zédé,
and Admiral Aube. The second submarine
ordered for the French Navy
was the <i>Gustave Zédé</i>, launched in 1893.
So successful did this vessel prove that
another of the same type, and named
the <i>Morse</i>, was launched at Cherbourg
Dockyard in 1899. In the same year
four vessels of a new type were laid
down in the dockyard at Rochefort, and
named <i>Lutin</i>, <i>Farfâdet</i> (re-named <i>Follet</i>),
<i>Korrigan</i>, and <i>Gnôme</i>. These, with the
exception of the ill-fated <i>Lutin</i>, are still
in the active flotillas.</p>

8 knots when submerged. Their range
of action is about 200 miles at 7 knots.
The armament consists of one bow tube

named the <i>Petr Kochka</i>. She was built
in sections to facilitate transport over the
Siberian Railway, being intended for
the defence of Port Arthur, and had a
surface displacement of only 20 tons.
Her armament consisted of two holders,
or Darzewiecki launching apparatus, containing
two small Whitehead torpedoes.
The maximum speed was 8 knots on
the surface and 4 knots when submerged.
The second submarine ordered for the
Russian Navy was the <i>Delphin</i>, which
foundered off Kronstadt, but was subsequently
raised and is now used as a
training ship for the submarine service.
These two vessels have been removed
from the active flotillas, but the third
vessel to be built for the Russian Navy—the
<i>Graf Cheremetieve</i>—is still in
commission.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>On “The Day”—August 4th, 1914—Germany
possessed 30 submarine torpedo-boats<a id='tn117'></a>.
These were divided into
three flotillas, with their headquarters at
Kiel, the largest and most modern
vessels being attached to the Heligoland
or North Sea Flotilla. During 1913,
although 24 submarines were stated as
being in commission, only about 15
were actively employed, and these mostly
in training reserves, the older boats
being docked and modernized where
possible. But during the year six new
vessels were added to the flotilla and the
<i>personnel</i> of the submarine service was
largely increased. At the same time the
inspection of submarines was separated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>from that of the other torpedo-boats and
a flag-officer was appointed as head of
the submarine branch of the Naval
Service, with headquarters at Kiel.
Thus when the hour came for the great
struggle which was to decide the mastery
of the seas the whole German Flotilla of
30 vessels, <i>with a reserve of six new boats
which had been secretly hurried forward
and were rapidly nearing completion</i>, was
ready to put to sea.</p>

<p class='c022'>The German Naval Law provided for
the construction of 72 submarines by the
end of 1917. All the vessels built up
to the present time have been known as
the “U” class and numbered in rotation.
They are painted a brownish-grey colour
and have high collier-like bows with
massive armoured conning-towers and
long superstructures amounting to narrow
decks. They have all been built at
either Kiel or Dantzig.</p>

<p class='c022'>Although the first submarine boats
built for the German Navy were two
vessels of the Nordenfeldt type, launched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>in 1890, they were never actively employed
with the fleet and have long since
been reduced to scrap-iron, and the first
vessel which can now be reckoned as a
fighting unit of the German torpedo-boat
flotilla was a vessel designated the
“U.1.” This was built at the Germania
Shipyard, Kiel, and launched on August
30th, 1905. This was the forerunner of
the “U” class, which in most of the
essential features resembles the British
Improved Holland type.</p>

<p class='c022'>This U.1 was built as an experimental
boat by the famous firm of
Krupps. She has a surface displacement
of 197 tons, a submerged displacement
of 236 tons, and her heavy-oil surface
engines are of 250 <span class='fss'>H.-P.</span> The electric
motors for submerged use develop just
over 100 <span class='fss'>H.-P.</span> The speed ranges from
10 knots an hour on the surface to 7
knots when submerged, and her surface
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>range of action is about 700 to 800 miles.
The armament consists of one bow torpedo
tube and three (17.7) Schwartzkopf
torpedoes are carried. The complement
is nine officers and men.</p>

<p class='c022'>The trials of the U.1 extended over
a period of a year and a half, and all
proved remarkably satisfactory. During
the tests which took place in Eckernforder
Bay she succeeded, twice in
succession, in torpedoing a moving target
while travelling submerged at full speed.</p>

<p class='c022'>The uncertainty displayed for some
years previous by the German Naval
Authorities regarding the value of submarine
boats gave place to a thorough
sense of the important part these
“mighty atoms” would play in future
naval warfare, and to a strong determination
that the German Navy should
include a powerful submarine flotilla.</p>

<p class='c022'>These are the six vessels which are
rapidly nearing completion, and which
were in a much more advanced state,
at the opening of hostilities, than was
generally known in foreign naval circles.
They are the same in almost every
respect as the vessels U.25 to U.30.
There is, however, another submarine
being built for Germany of a totally
different design. This is the F.I.A.T.
or <i>Laurenti</i> boat (Italian), laid down at
the beginning of 1914. This vessel is
very similar to the four “S” boats being
built at Greenock for the British Navy.</p>

<p class='c022'>No German submarines have in the

station. Therefore, the whole flotilla
of 30 to 36 vessels was immediately available
for operations in the North Sea and
Baltic when war began. The <i>personnel</i>
of the whole torpedo service is very
efficient, great attention having been
paid to this branch of the Navy. The
three German Submarine flotillas have
their headquarters at Kiel, Wilhelmshaven,
and Heligoland.</p>

down from the surface to the sea-bed
by an ingenious system of wire-hawsers
and drop-weights, which can be released
in the event of accident. A “diving
chamber” enables members of the crew
to don diving-dresses and leave the submarine
when on the sea-bed, for the

  <h2 id='ch8' class='c014'>CHAPTER VIII <br /> <br /> <span class='c020'>SUBMARINES IN ACTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Submarines have two great advantages
over all types of surface warships; they
can become invisible at will—or sufficiently
invisible to make gun or torpedo-practice,
except at very close quarters,
almost entirely useless—and they can,
by sinking, cover themselves with armour-plate
of sufficient thickness to be absolutely
shell-proof. These are the two
main points in favour of the submarine.
There are, however, many minor features.
Although submarines are known in the
naval services as “daylight torpedo-boats,”
for their <i>greatest</i> value lies in
their ability to perform the same task in
the “light” as the ordinary surface torpedo-boats
and destroyers can do under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>cover of darkness or fog—that of creeping
up close to an enemy, and launching a
torpedo unobserved—they have been
given, during recent years, so much
greater speed, armament, and range of
action, that they can no longer be looked
upon as small boats just suitable for daylight
torpedo attack in favourable circumstances.
Their surface speed has been
increased from 10 to 20 knots, making
them almost as fast as the surface torpedo-boat.
This, combined with <a id='tn134'></a>manœuvering
powers and general above-water invisibility,
has enabled them to take over the
duty of the surface torpedo-boat—that
of delivering night-attacks on the surface.
After nightfall a submarine attack is
almost impossible owing to the periscope—the
eyes of the submarine—being
useless in the dark.</p>

<p class='c022'>The increase in the armament of the
submarine—from the single bow torpedo
tube with two torpedoes of short range
and weak explosive charge, to the four
bow and two stern tubes with eight or ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>torpedoes of long range and high
explosive charge—has greatly increased
their chances of successful attack on
surface warships, first, by giving them
four or six shots ahead, then the possibility,
in the event of all these
torpedoes missing, of a dive under the
object of attack, and two more shots
at close range from the stern tubes
(still retaining two torpedoes); and,
secondly, by increasing the distance
from which the first projectile can be
launched, owing to the increased range
of the modern torpedo. There are also
the advantages derived from the battery
of quick-firing guns installed on the
decks of modern submarines. Although
at the present time these guns are
only of small power they nevertheless
afford a means of defence—and even
of attack under favourable circumstances—against
hostile surface torpedo-boats,
destroyers, and air-craft. In fact, a
flotilla of submarines could undoubtedly
now give a very good account of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>itself if attacked either on the surface
or when submerged by one or two
prowling destroyers. The increase in
the power of the guns carried by submarines,
which will certainly come soon,
will enable this type of craft to take
up the additional duties of the destroyer—that
of clearing the seas of hostile
torpedo-boats and carrying out advanced
scouting—for which work their ability
to travel submerged and in a state of
invisibility for distances of over 100
miles makes them eminently suitable.</p>

<p class='c022'>The enormous increase in the size
and range of action of submarines,
combined with the improvements effected
in the surface cruising qualities, have
enabled these vessels to be taken from
the “nursery” of harbour and coast
defence and placed with the sea-going
flotillas and battle-fleets. In the short
period of ten years the tonnage of
submarines has risen from 100 to over
1,000 tons, and the range of action
from 400 miles at economical speed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>5,000 miles. Exactly what this means
is more easily realized when it is
stated that the earlier types of submarines
could scarcely cross the English
Channel and return without taking in
supplies of fuel, and in rough weather
were forced to remain in harbour,
whereas the modern vessel can go
from England to Newfoundland <i>and
back</i> without assistance, and can remain
at sea in almost any weather, as was
first demonstrated by the successful
voyage of the British submarines A.E.1
and A.E.2 to Australia, and has since
been proved by the operations of the
British submarine flotilla in the North
Sea.</p>

<p class='c022'>In addition to the cruising range
there is, however, the question of
habitability. In this respect the progress
has been equally as rapid. In
the older boats no sleeping accommodation
was provided for the crew, and
food supplies and fresh water sufficient
only for a few days were carried. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>latest British, French and German
vessels proper sleeping and messing
accommodation is provided, and supplies
of all kinds and in sufficient quantity
to last a month are carried. Although
work on these craft is still very
cramping for the crew, the increase in
the deck space and in the surface
buoyancy has greatly minimised the
discomforts of service in the submarine
flotilla.</p>

<p class='c022'>With regard to safety, it has already
been shown that a submarine is only held
below the surface by the power of her
engines and the action of the water on
her diving-rudders. This means that in
the event of anything going wrong
<i>inside</i> the vessel she would automatically
rise to the surface; but should the hull
be pierced in any way, either by shot
or by collision, and an overwhelming
inrush of water result—overcoming the
buoyancy quickly obtained by blowing
out the water-ballast tanks—then the
vessel must inevitably sink, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>question of whether or not the crew
can save themselves becomes a problem
to which no definite answer can be given,
although a special means is provided in
all modern vessels belonging to the British
Navy. Speaking generally, it may, however,
be said that if the disaster occurs
suddenly, and the vessel sinks into very
deep water rapidly, the chances of life-saving
are extremely small; but if the
water is comparatively shallow, as along
the coast (100 to 150 feet), the likelihood
of many of the crew being able to save
themselves with the aid of the <i>special
escape helmets and air-locks</i> is fairly good.</p>

<p class='c022'>We now come to the most important
improvement made in the fighting qualities
of these vessels since first they came into
being, viz. the wonderful increase in the
surface and submerged speed. In the
older craft the surface speed did not
exceed 8 to 10 knots an hour, whereas it
now amounts to 16 to 20 knots, and the
submerged speed has risen from 5 knots
to 10 to 12 knots. It is a little difficult
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>for any but a naval man to realize exactly
what this increase in the speed of submarines
really means, and it is equally as
difficult to adequately describe it here in
non-technical language. It is a mere
platitude to say that in order to attack a
surface warship the submarine must first
get within torpedo range of it; and yet it
is on this very point that the strategy and
tactics of submarine warfare revolve. A
clever naval tactician once described the
submarine as a “handicapped torpedo-boat.”
The two points on which he
based this opinion were—the (then) slow
speed of these vessels compared with that
of the surface warship, and its almost
total blindness when submerged. These
two defects were for some years the
principal drawbacks of all the submarines
afloat; but since that naval expert pronounced
submarines to be “handicapped
torpedo-boats,” great changes, great improvements
have been made. The speed
of the submarine has increased by over
100 per cent., and they have been given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>longer and wider range of vision by the
introduction of two and three improved
periscopes instead of one elementary
instrument. Nevertheless, the speed
difficulty is still a very real one, as
will readily be seen when it is taken
into consideration that the speed of a
submarine when attacking submerged is
frequently only half, or even a third,
of that of her enemy. In order to
more clearly illustrate this and lift for
a moment the veil of secrecy which
enshrouds the methods of attack adopted
by this type of craft, it will be necessary
to describe what is known as the<i> right-angle
attack</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c026'><span class='sc'>Attacking at Right Angles.</span></h3>

<p class='c027'>The difficulty of attacking a surface
warship steaming at right angles to the
course of the submarine will be clearly
understood by referring to the following
diagrams. The first shows an attack on
a warship travelling at 20 miles an
hour, such as a big battleship or a cruiser
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Any increase in the speed of the surface
vessel not only adds to the difficulty of
the attacking submarine, but also the
direction from which the attack must be
made. This feature is shown in the
second diagram, which illustrates a submarine
attack on a vessel steaming
at 30 miles an hour, such as a fast
destroyer or fleet scout. On the other
hand, a decrease in the speed of the
on-coming surface vessel tends to either
make easier the task of the attacking
submarine, or else to increase the
distance from which the attack can be
delivered. This is shown in the third
diagram, which assumes the speed of the
surface vessel to be only 15 miles an
hour, such as a merchantman, troopship,
food-ship, collier, or old warship.</p>

<p class='c022'><a id='tn142-2'></a><span class='sc'>Fig. 1</span> represents a submarine attacking
a hostile warship (or fleet) steaming at
20 (statute) miles an hour. “A” is the
line of vision. The submarine sights the
warship at a distance of just over 11 miles
on her port bow. “B” shows the hostile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>vessel’s course, which is 10 miles to point
marked “C,” and each division beyond
equals 1 mile.</p>

<p class='c022'>Directly the submarine, which is
assumed to be lying in an <i>awash
condition</i>, sights the object of attack,
she totally submerges and steers forward
at a speed of 10 miles an hour.
The loss, and gain, of the submarine on
the different courses, can be seen in the
table above the chart.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c028'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'>The spaces between the black dots
show the most favourable points of
attack. It will be noticed in the table
that both vessels are equal at point “C,”
but for many reasons this is not the best
point of attack. The gain of about six
minutes on the longer course enables the
submarine not only to manœuvre into the
best possible position for the attack, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>also to discharge more than one torpedo
if necessary.</p>

<p class='c022'><a id='tn144'></a><span class='sc'>Fig. 2</span> shows the extreme limit at
which a submarine could, with reasonable
chances of success, attack a destroyer, or
other vessel, steaming at 30 (statute)
miles an hour, having sighted her at a
distance of 16 miles in the position
shown by the line of vision “A.”</p>

<p class='c022'>The distance to “C” is 15 miles
for the surface vessel, and 5 miles for
the submarine. Here, again, the two
vessels would be equal; but the most
favourable point of attack is shown by
the two black dots—where the submarine
has gained two minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Fig. 3.</span>—The submarine sights the
object of attack at a distance of 14 ¼
miles, in the position shown by the line
of vision “A.” The surface vessel has
a speed of only 15 miles an hour
(merchantman). In this case the surface
vessel accomplishes the 10-mile journey
along course “B”—arriving at point
“C” 20 minutes in advance of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>submarine. The table shows how the
submarine, by changing her course and
“throwing” the surface vessel on her
beam, gradually reduces the loss, until,
at the point marked with the two black
dots, she is but 4 ½ minutes behind. At
this distance she could fire her torpedoes at
long range, with some likelihood of success.</p>

<p class='c022'>Although these charts show approximately
the extreme limits of the right-angle
attack, a submarine could, of
course, proceed for some distance on
the surface at a much faster speed;
but considering the rate at which the
two vessels would be approaching each
other, the submarine which attempted
it would run considerable risk of being
detected, and thus destroy her chances
of a successful attack. Considering also
the time lost in sinking from the “light”
to the totally submerged condition, in
coming to close quarters, the gain in
speed would not amount to as much as
may at first seem probable.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c028'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'>The most favourable position for a
submarine flotilla is to manœuvre close
up to a fleet at anchor, or to get within
1,000 yards of a fleet—steaming across
its course; but both of these ideal
positions for attack are extremely
difficult to obtain, and consequently in
all the less favourable positions speed
is the deciding factor. Strategems will
undoubtedly play an important part in
submarine warfare. An example of this
has already been afforded when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>German submarines resorted to the
dishonest trick of laying in wait behind
a trawler engaged in laying mines, over
which <i>the flag of a neutral state</i> had
been hoisted as a blind. This resulted
in the loss of three British cruisers with
over 1,000 lives. It would, however,
be quite in accord with the rules of
<i>civilised</i> warfare for a submarine to
shelter behind a “decoy”; to attack
simultaneously with a seaplane; or to
approach an enemy behind one of its
own merchant ships.</p>

<h3 class='c026'><span class='sc'>The Porpoise Dive.</span></h3>

<p class='c027'>The manœuvre known as the “Porpoise
Dive” is merely the sudden rising of a
submarine in order to enable her commander
to get a better view of the surface
than that afforded by the periscope. The
submarine on approaching the object of
attack rises quickly to the surface by the
action of her horizontal rudders, then
dives again, only remaining above water
for a few seconds to enable her commander
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>to get a glimpse of the enemy,
and to take bearings. The submarine
can then get within torpedo-range, with
simply the tiny periscope projecting from
the surface. This manœuvre is now
seldom necessary, owing to the long and
wide range of vision of the two or three
periscopes fitted in modern submarines.</p>

<h3 class='c026'><span class='sc'>Difficulty of the Fixed Torpedo Tube.</span></h3>

<p class='c027'>With the exception of one or two
vessels, which it would be unwise to
specify, all the submarines engaged in
the present war have what are called
<i>fixed submerged tubes</i>. This means that
the tubes from which the torpedoes are
discharged are fitted <i>inside</i> the submarine
<i>on a line with the centre of the boat</i>, and
cannot be moved or aimed in any way
apart from the boat itself. It therefore
becomes necessary for the submarine to
be <i>aligned</i> by the steering rudders on the
object of attack before the torpedoes can
be discharged. In simpler vein, torpedoes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>can only be fired by a submarine straight
ahead or straight astern. Hence a
submarine, with a hostile warship coming
up on its beam, is compelled to turn and
face its opponent (or turn its stern towards
her) before delivering an attack.</p>

<h3 class='c026'><span class='sc'>Submarine Flotilla</span> <i>v.</i> <span class='sc'>Surface Fleet.</span></h3>

<p class='c027'>It is absolutely necessary for submarines
acting in company to have each
its allotted task; and for a wide space of
water to be left between each boat; as it
is impossible, at present, for one submarine
to know the exact position of
another when both vessels are submerged.
Therefore, if each boat was not previously
instructed how to act, there would not
only be the likelihood of the greater
portion of an attacking flotilla firing their
torpedoes at one or two vessels of the
hostile fleet and allowing the remainder
either to escape or to keep up a heavy
and dangerous fire unmolested, but also
of collision and of torpedoeing each other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>by accident. There is no means of
inter-communication between submarines
when submerged, and a battle between
submarines is almost impossible.</p>

<h3 class='c026'><span class='sc'>Surprise Attack.</span></h3>

<p class='c027'>In this case invisibility is the element
of success. Admiral Sir Cyprian Bridge,
G.C.B., in a letter to the Author once
said: “When submerged the concealment
of the submarine is practically perfect.
If she has not been sighted up to the
moment of diving, she will almost
certainly reach, unobserved, the point at
which she can make her attack.” And
this opinion—shared for many years by
all experts—has been amply proved in the
present war.</p>

<p class='c022'>A submarine must, however, blend with
the surrounding sea in its ever-varying
colours, lights and shades, in order that
she may be as invisible as possible when
cruising on the surface. The French
Naval Authorities experimented off
Toulon with a luminous paint of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>sea-green colour; but this, although
causing the hull to be almost totally
invisible in certain weather, was found
to be useless, as, on a bright day with
a blue sky, the green showed up clear
against the bluish tint of the surrounding
sea. After many months of experimenting,
a pale, sea-green, non-luminous
paint was chosen as the best colour
for French submarines. The British
Admiralty also carried out a few experiments
in this direction, and came to the
conclusion that a dull grey was the most
invisible shade. The German authorities
decided in favour of a grey-brown.</p>

<p class='c022'>When travelling submerged, with only
the thin periscopic tube above the surface,
it is almost impossible to detect the
approach of a submarine <i>before</i> she gets
within torpedo range; and when cruising
on the surface she is equally as invisible
at a distance of a few miles. These
qualities enable the submarine in nearly
all cases where her speed permits, to
effect a surprise attack on a hostile battleship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>or cruiser <i>when not closely screened by
fast destroyers</i>, whose duty it is to be ever
on the watch for submarines.</p>

<p class='c022'>As to the tactics which would be
employed by a submarine (or flotilla) in
attacking a hostile warship (or fleet), it
is impossible to say, for, like the
impromptu attacks of all “mosquito
craft,” the exact method, or manœuvre<a id='tn152'></a>,
is arranged to suit the circumstances,
and it is very seldom that two such
attacks are carried out alike. Generally
speaking, however, a hostile warship
could be easily sighted, on a fairly
clear day, from the flying-bridge of a
submarine at a distance of 10 miles; but
it would be practically impossible to
detect the submarine from the deck of
a warship at that distance. On sighting
her object of attack the submarine would
sink to the “awash” condition, and
proceed for from 2 ½ to 5 miles, as
might be deemed expedient. She would
then submerge and steer by her periscopes,
each of which has a field of vision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>of 60 degrees. He would be a very
keen look-out who would be able to
detect the few square inches of periscopic
tube at a distance of three miles.
As this distance lessened, it might be
advisable, if the sea was <i>very</i> calm and
if the object of attack was stationary,
for the submarine to slacken speed, so as
to prevent any spray being thrown off
by the periscopic tube. Assuming, however,
that the optical tube was seen by
the enemy, it would be extremely difficult
to hit it with gun-fire at a distance of one
or two miles, or to damage the boat itself,
which would probably be immersed to a
depth of 12 or 15 feet. At a distance of
about 2,000 yards, or just over one mile,
the submarine would discharge her first
torpedo, following it up with another
at closer range from the second bow
tube. A rapid dive would then probably
be necessary in order to avoid the hail
of shot which would plough up the waters
around her. If the first two torpedoes
missed their mark the submarine might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>either dive completely under the object
of attack and then fire her stern tubes
at close range, or else manœuvre below
the surface for an attack from some
other point.</p>

<p class='c022'>One of the effects produced on fleets
or individual warships in war time by
the ever present possibility of submarine
attack is, however, that they never
remain at anchor or even stationary in
an exposed position, and seldom—if wise—proceed
without destroyers as advance
and flank guards. These precautions
double the difficulties of a successful
submarine attack.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='c021'>In all warfare, new weapons of attack
are, sooner or later, met by new methods
of defence. The submarine and the
aeroplane are at present the only
weapons against which there is no true
means of defence, and yet one is being
used as an antidote for the other without,
however, any very striking success so far.
The seaplane may be able to distinguish
the dark patch in the sea caused by the
hull of the submarine <i>in clear water</i>,
but she cannot destroy it, neither can
she signal the <i>exact</i> locality to an
accompanying destroyer flotilla, owing
to the speed with which seaplane and
submarine pass over and under each
other; furthermore, in rough weather or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>in shallow muddy water no sign of the
submarine when submerged is visible
from above. The great value of the
seaplane as an antidote for submarines
lies, however, first in the fact that the
water of the open sea is usually clear,
and the <i>submarine shadow</i> is visible
from above, and, secondly, in the great
speed of these aircraft which enables
them to quickly cover miles of sea in
their search for hostile submarines and
to report their presence in a given
locality by wireless to all ships operating
within range.</p>

<p class='c022'>When the enormous superficial area of
a zone of war, such as the North Sea
and English Channel, is duly considered,
however, the difficulty in quickly and
reliably locating from the air the
few scattered “submarine shadows” will
be easily realized. To make this
method of locating submarines even
fairly reliable an enormous fleet of seaplanes
would be required. Again seaplanes
do not, in themselves, constitute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>a means of defence against submarine
attack, they merely increase the likelihood
of detection, but, in actual warfare,
it has now been proved that for every
submarine detected by seaplanes two
others pass quite unobserved.</p>

<p class='c022'>Many means of attack on submarines
have been proposed; and no doubt some
of these, in certain cases, would prove
effective; but none can be relied upon.
Therefore, one of the points in favour
of the submarine still remains without
its antidote. This is the <i>moral effect</i>;
for if there is no absolutely reliable
means of defence, there can be no
feeling of security for surface warships
or merchant vessels when anywhere
within the danger zone of the submarine.</p>

<p class='c022'>Let us now examine briefly what
practical methods of defence a modern
warship has against submarine attacks.
Great speed is undoubtedly a surface
ship’s most reliable defence; and when
combined with a frequent change of
course, would greatly reduce the chances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>of a successful under-water attack.
Should hostile submarines be on the
line of advance they would not know
whether to wait and chance the enemy
approaching within torpedo range or
whether to run to starboard or port.
This is, if the surface warship was
steaming in an erratic course—not a
zigzag course, for then it might be
possible to estimate, within torpedo
range, the position of the ship at a
given point if the “tacks” were regular.</p>

<p class='c022'>Should submarines be seen approaching,
a surface vessel would do well to turn
her stern to the attacking flotilla, presenting
as small a target as possible,
and deflecting the torpedoes by her
propeller race.</p>

<p class='c022'>The escape of the Battle Cruiser
<i>Queen Mary</i> and the Light Cruiser
<i>Lowestoft</i>, during the action in the
Heligoland Bight, as described in the
dispatch of Vice-Admiral Sir David
Beatty, K.C.B., demonstrates what may
be done by the skilful use of the helm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>on surface warships to frustrate submarine
attacks. So interesting, and informative
as to the actual fighting
between British warships and hostile
submarines, in this dispatch that I give
it here in full. It should, however, be
studied in conjunction with the comprehensive
report—the first in the
history of Naval warfare detailing submarine
attack and reconnaissance—from
Commodore Roger J. B. Keyes, C.B.,
of the British submarines, given on
page 28.</p>

<div class='c040'>“H.M.S. <i>Lion</i>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class='c040'><i>1st September, 1914</i>.</div>

<p class='c024'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—I have the honour to report
that on Thursday, 27th August, at 5 a.m.,
I proceeded with the First Battle Cruiser
Squadron and First Light Cruiser
Squadron in company, to rendezvous
with the Rear-Admiral, <i>Invincible</i>.</p>

<p class='c024'>“At 4 a.m., 28th August, the movements
of the Flotillas commenced as
previously arranged, the Battle Cruiser
Squadron and Light Cruiser Squadron
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>supporting. The Rear-Admiral, <i>Invincible</i>,
with <i>New Zealand</i> and four
Destroyers having joined my flag, the
Squadron passed through the pre-arranged
rendezvous.</p>

<p class='c024'>“At 8.10 a.m. I received a signal
from the Commodore (T), informing me
that the Flotilla was in action with the
enemy. This was presumably in the
vicinity of their pre-arranged rendezvous.
From this time until 11 a.m. I remained
about the vicinity ready to support as
necessary, intercepting various signals,
which contained no information on which
I could act.</p>

<p class='c024'>“At 11 a.m. the Squadron was attacked
by three Submarines. The attack
was frustrated by rapid manœuvring and
the four Destroyers were ordered to
attack them. Shortly after 11 a.m.,
various signals having been received
indicating that the Commodore (T) and
Commodore (S) were both in need of
assistance, I ordered the Light Cruiser
Squadron to support the Torpedo Flotillas.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“Later I received a signal from the
Commodore (T), stating that he was
being attacked by a large Cruiser, and
a further signal informing me that he
was being hard pressed and asking for
assistance. The Captain (D), First
Flotilla, also signalled that he was in
need of help.</p>

<p class='c024'>“From the foregoing the situation
appeared to me critical. The Flotillas
had advanced only ten miles since 8 a.m.,
and were only about twenty-five miles
from two enemy bases on their flank and
rear respectively. Commodore Goodenough
had detached two of his Light
Cruisers to assist some Destroyers earlier
in the day, and these had not yet rejoined.
(They rejoined at 2.30 p.m.). As
the reports indicated the presence of many
enemy ships—one a large Cruiser—I
considered that his force might not be
strong enough to deal with the situation
sufficiently rapidly, so at 11.30 a.m. the
Battle Cruisers turned to E.S.E., and
worked up to full speed. It was evident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>that to be of any value the support must
be overwhelming and carried out at the
highest speed possible.</p>

<p class='c024'>“I had not lost sight of the risk of
Submarines, and possible sortie in force
from the enemy’s base, especially in view
of the mist to the South-East.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Our high speed, however, made
submarine attack difficult, and the
smoothness of the sea made their detection
comparatively easy. I considered
that we were powerful enough to deal
with any sortie except by a Battle
Squadron, which was unlikely to come
out in time, provided our stroke was
sufficiently rapid.</p>

<p class='c024'>“At 12.15 p.m. <i>Fearless</i> and First
Flotilla were sighted retiring West. At
the same time the Light Cruiser
Squadron was observed to be engaging
an enemy ship ahead. They appeared
to have her beat.</p>

<p class='c024'>“I then steered N.E. to sounds of
firing ahead, and at 12.30 p.m. sighted
<i>Arethusa</i> and Third Flotilla retiring to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>the Westward engaging a Cruiser of the
<i>Kolberg</i> class on our Port Bow. I
steered to cut her off from Heligoland,
and at 12.37 p.m. opened fire. At 12.42
the enemy turned to N.E., and we chased
at 27 knots.</p>

<p class='c024'>“At 12.56 p.m. sighted and engaged
a two-funnelled Cruiser ahead. <i>Lion</i>
fired two salvoes at her, which took
effect, and she disappeared into the mist,
burning furiously and in a sinking condition.
In view of the mist and that she
was steering at high speed at right angles
to <i>Lion</i>, who was herself steaming at
28 knots, the <i>Lion’s</i> firing was very
creditable.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Our Destroyers had reported the
presence of floating mines to the Eastward
and I considered it inadvisable to
pursue her. It was also essential that
the Squadrons should remain concentrated,
and I accordingly ordered a
withdrawal. The Battle Cruisers turned
North and circled to port to complete the
destruction of the vessel first engaged.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>She was sighted again at 1.25 p.m.
steaming S.E. with colours still flying.
<i>Lion</i> opened fire with two turrets, and at
1.35 p.m., after receiving two salvoes, she
sank.</p>

<p class='c024'>“The four attached Destroyers were
sent to pick up survivors, but I deeply
regret that they subsequently reported
that they searched the area but found
none.</p>

<p class='c024'>“At 1.40 p.m. the Battle Cruisers
turned to the Northward, and <i>Queen
Mary</i> was again attacked by a Submarine.
The attack was avoided by the use of
the helm. <i>Lowestoft</i> was also unsuccessfully
attacked. The Battle Cruisers
covered the retirement until nightfall.
By 6 p.m., the retirement having been
well executed and all Destroyers accounted
for, I altered course, spread the
Light Cruisers, and swept northwards in
accordance with the Commander-in-Chief’s
orders. At 7.45 p.m. I detached
<i>Liverpool</i> to Rosyth with German
prisoners, seven officers and 79 men,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>survivors from <i>Mainz</i>. No further incident
occurred.—I have the honour to
be, Sir, your obedient Servant.</p>

<p class='c022'>Quick-firing guns of the 3-inch and
6-inch type are certainly the best weapons
for an attack on submarines. In combination
with “sharp look-outs,” they
could be used with effect from the
elevated positions on the fore part of
warships. The periscopic-tube of the
submarine always proves a target for
gun-fire; but a grey steel tube, 3 inches
in diameter, at a distance of 1,000 yards
requires “excellent” marksmanship to
hit. That it can be done is proved by
the sinking of the German submarine
U.15 by the British Cruiser <i>Birmingham</i>
in the North Sea. The effect of a shot
carrying away the periscope is to blind
the submarine, at least in one eye, she
can then be <i>run-down</i> by the surface
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>warship or destroyed by rapid gun-fire at
close range.</p>

<p class='c022'>Of course, if submarines were caught
napping on the surface the guns of surface
warships could quickly sink them; but
another incident, similar to that which
opened the naval engagements of the
Russo-Japanese War, cannot be looked
for in the naval engagements to come.</p>

<p class='c022'>For a fleet engaged in bombarding or
blockading, one of the best methods of
defence would be to lower the torpedo
nets, not close round each vessel, but
suspended from “picket-boats” at a distance
from the bombarding or blockading
fleet. “Picketing” is also considered a
good defence during daylight, but
neither of these methods are reliable.
A submarine might be able to dive
unobserved under, or past, the destroyers
acting as pickets, and it is this
chance which causes these under-water
craft to be a source of constant anxiety.</p>

<p class='c022'>The torpedo-boat destroyer should
prove a nasty enemy to the submarine.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>In warfare it is the duty of these 30-knot
vessels to look after their under-water
opponents.</p>

<p class='c022'>It has been suggested that internal
armour could be fitted to warships
below the water-line, which would
render the hulls able to withstand mine
or torpedo explosions. At present this
is practically impossible, as the great
weight of this additional armour, combined
with the ever-increasing size of
guns and weight of above-water protection,
would necessitate a vessel of
such enormous displacement as to be
quite impossible, if the important factor—high
speed—has also to be maintained.</p>

<p class='c022'>The defence of harbours against submarines
is a problem which does not
present nearly so many difficulties as
the defence of moving ships. Portsmouth,
for example, is closed by means
of a submarine boom-defence, which is
stretched across the mouth of the
harbour. The entrance to the River
Elbe (leading to the Kaiser Wilhelm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Canal) is effectively closed to British
submarines by boom-defences, mines, and
submerged wire entanglements. Narrow
waterways, such as the Straits of Dover,
can be closed by the laying of contact-mines,
and even broader seas can be
made dangerous to submarines by the
same method. An example of this is
afforded by the laying of a British
mine-field somewhere between the
Goodwin Sands and the Dutch Coast, to
prevent German submarines from penetrating
into the English Channel.</p>

<p class='c022'>There are so many reliable means
of defending harbours and narrow
waterways against submarines that it is
unnecessary to say anything further
here. But to protect moving ships at
sea, under all conditions, certainly presents
a most profound puzzle.</p>

  <h2 id='ch10' class='c014'>CHAPTER X <br /> <br /> <span class='c020'>THE SUBMARINE TORPEDO</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The submarine torpedo has become one
of the principal naval arms. Not only
does it supply the chief offensive power
of the submarine, the torpedo-boat and
the destroyer, but it is also carried as a
separate arm, with a special highly-trained
crew, by almost every warship afloat.
At the beginning of hostilities the Naval
Powers engaged owned considerably over
80,000 of these weapons, and <i>one</i> factory
in England alone can make them at the
rate of two a day. During the first few
weeks of the <i>Great War</i> the torpedo
was responsible for the sinking of warships
to the value of over one million sterling.
Had the German Fleet been on the high
seas instead of in harbour and protected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>from torpedo raids by carefully-prepared
submarine defences, there is little
doubt but what several more of the
enemy’s ships would have been sunk
by this weapon. The fact that at first
the British light cruisers suffered rather
heavily—though in total loss of ships and
men less than the German Navy—does
not point to any advantage derived either
from the type of torpedo used or from
skill in this mode of warfare possessed by
the Germans, but clearly to the timidity
of the German main fleet, which was at
the very beginning of hostilities withdrawn
from the zone of war and placed behind
fortifications, where it was safe from
torpedo attack. The British Fleet, true
to the policy of “attack and not defence,”
began operations the moment war was
declared, with results so brilliantly successful,
and of such far-reaching and
world-wide importance, that enumeration is
well-nigh impossible. But while all these
operations were in progress the British
Fleet was more or less exposed to torpedo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>attack by any hostile submarines or fast
surface craft which might succeed in
getting past the cordon of protecting
destroyers, while the German Fleet was
safe, but ignominiously impotent. That
the naval losses of Great Britain, with
all her fleets at sea, have not been far
greater than they have is in itself a victory
of the greatest magnitude—a victory due
entirely to consummate naval skill.</p>

<p class='c022'>The modern torpedo varies in length
from 14 to 19 feet, and weighs up to
half a ton. It has an extreme range
of 4,000 yards, or just over 2 ¼ miles.
There are three types of torpedoes in
use by the fleets at war. The British
use the <i>Whitehead Torpedo</i>, the French
the Whitehead and the <i>Schneider</i>, the
Russians and the Japanese use the
Whitehead; the Germans have a type
of their own, known as the <i>Schwartzkopf</i>,
and the Austrian arm is principally the
Whitehead. All these types are alike in
their essential features, and therefore need
not be described separately.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>The latest pattern 18-inch Whitehead
torpedo is propelled by compressed air
stored in that section of the weapon
known as the <i>air-chamber</i> (see diagram).
The air on being released is heated and
expanded in a tiny three or four-cylinder
engine which operates twin screws,
moving “clockwise” and “anti-clockwise.”
The “war-head” contains about
200 pounds of wet gun-cotton which is
exploded on the torpedo striking an

<p class='c022'>Torpedoes are fired—or ejected—into
the sea from surface or submerged
tubes, and on striking the water are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>propelled by their own engines in an
absolutely straight course towards the
target. The exact mechanism of the
submerged tube—which is used in
surface warships as well as in submarines—is
a naval secret. When fired from
a surface tube the torpedo sinks immediately
to a depth of about 10 to 14
feet, and maintains this depth until it
strikes its object. When fired from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>submerged tube it rises—if necessary—to
the same level. A torpedo always
proceeds towards its object of attack at
a depth of a few feet below the surface.
This, combined with speed, renders
it almost impossible to destroy an
approaching torpedo by gun-fire. So
marvellous is the mechanism of these
little weapons that in anything like
favourable circumstances they may be
<i>depended upon</i>, if well aimed, to strike
within a yard or two of the spot aimed
at. This accuracy is due almost
entirely to the gyroscope, which,
briefly described, is a rotating wheel
automatically controlling the torpedo’s
course.</p>

<p class='c022'>Although for many years torpedoes
have been carried by nearly all types
of service warships, none of them were
really ideal for this kind of warfare. A
new field for the torpedo was, however,
opened out by the introduction of the
submarine boat. In order to be effective
the torpedo must be discharged from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>distance under 4,000 yards—preferably
from a point less than half this distance
from the object of attack. This means
that the vessel carrying the torpedo
would have to get within a mile, or at
least a mile and a-half, of her object
of attack before discharging a torpedo.
For a surface vessel to accomplish this in
the face of a heavy cannonade from quick-firing
guns would be extremely risky.
To make a quick rush to close quarters,
if possible, by several vessels from
different points, was the only chance of
delivering a successful torpedo attack
on a hostile warship; unless, of course,
she was favoured by fog or darkness
<i>at the right moment</i>—favourable conditions
which would seldom obtain in
actual warfare. Again, every increase in
the speed of the big surface warship
rendered the task of the ordinary torpedo-boat
and destroyer more difficult because
in the event of a threatened attack the
larger vessel would make use of her
speed to keep out of torpedo range while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>her powerful guns were repelling the
attacking torpedo-boat.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <i>hour</i> of the torpedo came with
the <i>perfection</i> of the submarine. All the
conditions of an ideal torpedo-boat were
fulfilled—<i>invisibility</i> rendering daylight
attacks possible; <i>almost perfect immunity
from gun-fire</i> enabling the torpedo to be
discharged at closer range; <i>submerged
discharge</i> removing the likelihood of
the weapon being exploded by accurate
gun-fire before being discharged; <i>speed on
the surface</i> enabling the “carrying”
vessel to manœuvre for position; <i>moderate
speed when submerged</i> enabling an
attack under all reasonably tactical
conditions; and <i>comparatively large displacement</i>
giving good cruising qualities,
wide range of action, and enabling a
large number of torpedoes and tubes
being carried.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>If the Russo-Japanese war was the
first to fully demonstrate the value of
the explosive mine, the Great European
Conflict has certainly brought this weapon
to the forefront in the rapidly growing
science of submarine warfare. During
the first few weeks of the naval fighting
several warships, beginning with H.M.S.
<i>Amphion</i>, and many merchant vessels
representing millions of pounds sterling,
were destroyed by these weapons. Had
it not been for the foresight of the
British Admiralty in providing a very
large fleet of mine-sweepers, aided by
seaplanes, there can be no doubt but
what the shipping of all countries—neutrals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>and belligerents alike—would
have suffered far greater losses.</p>

<p>A GERMAN SUBMARINE TROTYL MINE ON THE DECK OF A MINE-LAYER.<br /><br /><span class='c006'>These mines contain the famous T.N.T., or Trotyl explosive.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>The indiscriminate scattering of mines
across the trade routes, as carried on
by Germany immediately on the outbreak
of war, and before hardly any of the
ships at sea belonging to neutral
countries could be warned to avoid the
zone of operations, has never before been
so ruthlessly resorted to by a big civilised
power.</p>

<p class='c022'>The system of defence consists of the
mooring of these mines in such positions
as to make it almost impossible for hostile
ships to pass without either striking or
coming within the destructive zone of one
or more of them. What are known as
<i>floating mines</i> are those set adrift to be
washed about by the tide. They explode
immediately on being struck by a passing
vessel, and, of course, do not discriminate
between friend and foe. The systems of
destroying hostile mine-fields consist of
<i>counter-mining</i>, or placing other mines in
the enemy’s field and destroying it by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>their explosion, and by <i>sweeping</i>. The
latter method is the one mostly employed
in modern warfare. The boats taking
part in the <i>sweep</i> place themselves one
on each side of the mine-field, and
between them hangs a long wire rope,
weighted in the centre to keep it well
submerged. They then move forward,
sweeping the mines to the surface or
exploding them harmlessly. It is, however,
very dangerous but highly necessary
work.</p>

<p class='c022'>There are two kinds of submarine
mines, one is designed to explode on
being struck by a passing vessel, and is
called a <i>contact mine</i>, and the other is
fired from the shore by an electric
current, and is known as an <i>observation
mine</i>. The explosive principally used is
wet gun-cotton or Trotyl, owing not only
to the safety with which they can be
stored and manipulated, but also to the
fact that they seldom explode in sympathy
with neighbouring mines, requiring to be
actually fired. The importance of this will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>be more fully realised when it is remembered
that in warfare it is often necessary
to explode certain mines over which hostile
ships are endeavouring to pass, while
leaving others in fairly close proximity
intact, ready to repel a second invasion
or to destroy ships nearer to them. The
actual explosion is caused by an electric
current, either from the shore or from a
battery in the mine itself, causing the
detonation of fulminate of mercury in
conjunction with a small priming charge
of dry gun-cotton. Mines are often laid
in a series, connected to a battery on the
sea-bed in the centre of the line of
defence.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <i>observation mine</i> is mostly used for
defending the approaches to harbours, as
an observer on shore can watch the movements
of hostile warships and explode
each mine when the vessel passes over
it. <i>Contact mines</i>, on the other hand, are
used wherever an enemy’s fleet is likely
to pass. They are anchored to the sea-bed
by means of a cable and heavy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>weight, and are allowed to float a few
feet below the surface. They explode
immediately on contact. At times an
unscrupulous or demoralised enemy will
simply throw a number of these mines
overboard and allow them to float at the
mercy of wind and tide. They then
become a terrible danger to the shipping
of all nations, as once they are left
unwatched it is extremely difficult to tell
with any degree of certainty where they
will eventually proclaim their presence
by devastating explosions. Happily for
the whole seafaring world, this method is
seldom resorted to, as mines set adrift in
this way become a danger to both friend
and foe. In the Russo-Japanese war
several ships were destroyed by their
own mines.</p>

<p class='c022'>There are many different kinds of submarine
mines, both of the observation
and the contact type. Some are spherical
in shape and others cylindrical. Some
are moored close down to the sea-bed
with a very heavy explosive charge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>(200‒500 lbs. of gun-cotton), and have
a small buoyant globe floating above
them, which, when struck, fires the mine
below. Others, known as secret-mines,
are kept continually moored in the waterways
leading to important naval harbours,
and are only allowed to rise sufficiently
high from the sea-bed to be struck by
passing vessels in times of emergency.
The type most generally used is, however,
the ordinary <i>offensive contact mine</i>,
which contains a powerful explosive
charge and is anchored in the path of
hostile warships. These mines are
usually automatically sown in large
numbers over a wide area of sea by the
mine-laying fleets.</p>

  <h2 id='ch12' class='c014'>CHAPTER XII <br /> <br /> <span class='c020'>MINE-LAYING FLEETS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The <i>regular</i> mine-laying fleets of the
powers at war are composed of the
following vessels, all of which are fitted
with special apparatus for the work.
Submarine mines can, however, be laid
by any vessel, and it is therefore almost
impossible to say exactly what ships are
engaged in this work. Both Germany
and Austria have converted a large
number of their merchantmen into mine-layers.
England, in reply, has converted
a large number of small steamers into
<i>mine-sweepers</i>. Russia is a strong
believer in explosive mines, and has
strewn the gulfs of Finland and Riga
with them. Japan, being on the
offensive, is employing more mine-sweepers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>than layers. France has an
elaborate system of submarine mine
defence for all her important harbours,
and maintains a small fleet at each base,
known as the “defence mobile.” These
vessels are all capable of both mine-laying
and sweeping.</p>

<p class='c022'>The submarine mine is primarily the
defence of the weaker naval power,
and therefore a fleet acting on the
defensive, either temporarily or permanently,
requires more mine-layers than
mine-sweepers, but the reverse is
naturally the case with a fleet acting
on the offensive. Although this may
be taken as a general rule, it does not
imply that a strong naval power like
Great Britain, whose policy is attack
and not defence, needs no mines or
mine-layers. On the contrary, the
laying of <i>counter</i> mines is one of the
ways of destroying an enemy’s mine-field;
and even the strongest fleet
cannot guard every portion of a long
coast line with many harbours exposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>to attack. The judicious laying of
mine-fields will often prevent raids by
hostile submarines and torpedo-boats;
and will limit the theatre of operations,
as was done by the British Navy in the
southern portion of the North Sea in
October, 1914. The axiom that a really
strong navy needs to be strong in <i>every</i>
branch, therefore holds good in this, as
in all other respects.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>For clearing away the mines dropped
by an enemy special vessels are employed.
Each vessel is fitted on both
sides with a curious contrivance known
as the “picking-up gear.” This
apparatus is lowered into the water,
and “picks up” any mines which may
lie in the path of an <a id='tn196'></a>on-coming fleet.
When a mine-field is discovered by
either destroyers or seaplanes these
vessels are immediately dispatched to
destroy it; and they are aided, in the
case of the British Navy, by a large
flotilla of steam trawlers. Many of
these auxiliary vessels are not fitted
with the <i>picking-up gear</i>, but go to work
in pairs. Two vessels, connected together
by a long wire rope weighted in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>the centre to keep it submerged, range
themselves on each side of a mine-field,
and by steaming ahead in a parallel line
sweep up the mines floating between
them. This process can be carried on
simultaneously by a large number of
trawlers, covering a very wide area of
sea. In the meantime the attached
destroyers and seaplanes can be
searching for new fields. It often
happens during sweeping operations
that mines are brought into contact with
each other and violent explosions occur.
Sometimes the vessels engaged in this
hazardous work will themselves strike
one of the mines, but it is more often
the <i>searching</i> flotillas which meet with
sudden disaster in this way. Fully
equipped mine-sweepers usually precede
a fleet of battleships and big cruisers
through dangerous and narrow seas,
within the likely zone of hostile mines.</p>

<p class='c022'>The British Mine-Sweeping Fleet
comprises the following vessels:—<i>Circe</i>
(810 tons), <i>Jason</i> (810 tons), <i>Speedy</i> (810
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>tons), <i>Leda</i> (810 tons), <i>Gossamer</i> (735
tons), <i>Seagull</i> (735 tons), <i>Skipjack</i> (735
tons), and <i>Speedwell</i> (735 tons).</p>

<p class='c022'>These eight vessels are obsolete torpedo-gunboats
which have been specially
fitted out for the work of mine-sweeping.
There is also a large flotilla of steam
fishing trawlers engaged. Some of these
vessels were purchased by the Admiralty
before the war, and were also equipped
for mine-sweeping; but many others were,
by special arrangement, handed over to
the Navy on the outbreak of war. The
whole of the mine-sweeping fleet is
manned by a special section of the Royal
Naval Reserve, known as the “Trawler
Section,” which consists of about 142
<i>skippers</i> and 1,136 men. This is, of
course, in addition to the several
thousand naval sailors employed on the
regular mine-sweepers, named above,
and also to those employed on the large
number of additional small steamers taken
over for this work by the Admiralty at
the commencement of hostilities. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>estimated that the task of keeping the
North Sea clear of mines during the first
four weeks of the Great War required
over 100 vessels and 5,000 sailors, in
addition to the usual destroyer and submarine
patrols with their crews, and also
to the seaplanes with their pilots and
observers.</p>

<p class='c022'>Almost any steamship can be quickly
converted into an effective mine-sweeper,
and for this reason it is impossible to
give here more than the very briefest
information concerning the vessels
employed in these operations by the
other Naval Powers at war. Russia had
fifteen special mine-sweeping vessels
building when war broke out; but,
doubtless, many small merchant ships
have since been used for this purpose.
France employed a number of mine-sweepers
in the Adriatic; and Japan
used some in clearing the approaches to
Tsing-tau. Germany and Austria, of
course, did not need many vessels of
this kind, as the Allied Navies laid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>comparatively few mines and German
oversea commerce ceased to exist almost
as soon as war was declared. It was
in the North Sea, during the first phase
of the naval war, that the value of a big
British mine-sweeping fleet made itself
so wonderfully apparent.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>Tempered and tried in the forge of
war the submarine has at last been
lifted from the experimental stage of
naval construction to the fore-front of
fleets in being. For over twenty years
naval experts, marine engineers and
scientists have been wrestling with the
vast and complex problems of submarine
construction, navigation and warfare, and
have, at a cost of many lives and many
millions sterling, produced submersible
warships of steadily increasing size and
power, until to-day 264 of these vessels,
of over a dozen different and more or
less secret designs, with displacements
ranging from 100 to 1,000 tons are in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>the fighting line of the Fleets at war.
Thousands of sailors have been trained
to fight beneath the seas; torpedoes,
guns, engines, and even the air to breath,
have been adapted for submarine work.
A comparison, therefore, of the strength
and fighting power of the submarine
fleets engaged for the first time in this
great struggle for the mastery of the
seas is of more than passing interest.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
